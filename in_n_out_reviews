My mom and I are on a more healthy diet and coming here kind of threw us off but you know it would have been longer going home and preparing something ourselves. 

I don't always have my mom pay for my food but without her saying anything I had a feeling she wanted to do it because I had bought breakfast, lunch and dinner for her several times within the last few weeks (all spaced out of course). It was a great night because I got to spend some quality time with just my mom.

We don't have In-N-Out Burger here on the east coast, so when in Las Vegas, we figured we had to go.  There is no good way to get there if you are on the strip.  Even though it is down the street from the strip, you pretty much have to take a cab.  Sadly the cab ride is more expensive then the food itself.  But I guess that is part of the experience.  When we got there the line was literally out the door.  This scared us, but the line did move pretty fast.  My husband ordered the double double animal style, I ordered the cheeseburger meal with fries and a drink.  I did not get animal style as I wasn't sure if I would like the sauce or not.  I should have gotten cheese fries, but I didn't.  While my husband was waiting to get our order, I searched and searched for a seat.  Finally I was able to grab a seat in the corner.  

When my husband brought our food to the table, it looked good.  I am glad I got the cheeseburger and not the double double, as it was just enough for me.  The bun was fresh and soft and slightly warm, the burger was extremely juicy, and the special sauce complimented the burger nicely.  The burger also had a good amount of lettuce and tomatoes on it.  The abundance of fries was just right.  My husband's double double animal style was double meat, double cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles.   He too was very pleased with this meal.  In-N-Out is known for all fresh ingredients, never frozen.  I have to say I enjoyed it and thought it was much better than a five guys.  Since everyone is pretty much taking a cab to get to In-N-Out, it is pretty easy to get a cab back.  I wish they had In-N-Out burger here on the east coast!",2,MEQAAU6FlZmqbAh1s54kRA

traveling by bus from the strip will cost you $1.75 each way.  the wait for the bus was never more than 10 minutes.  keep in mind, that the bus fees are different from the bus fees on the ""deuce"" bus, which is $3 each way.

Not much to say about this burger, the price can't be beat anywhere in town to match the quality. Most fast food patties I wouldn't consider eating on their own, or even looking at too closely for that matter, but theirs are good no matter what. I'd almost venture to say it's real beef? The patties are never frozen, and supposedly they only locate their restaurants to within a certain driving distance of any food prepping location. The lettuce, tomato and sauce are all fresh, and almost even refreshing on the burger. I personally love the fries, although they're almost always cooked inconsistently throughout with some overdone, and some undercooked all in the mix. The fries are a bit of a controversy with most people I know, some people hate them, some love them. As for their flavor, think of those old school Potato Sticks. Still, for the value this meal can't be beat. You do get that slightly off stomach ache after a meal here that you don't necessarily get from higher end places, but I compel you to find something better for $6 all in. The shakes are great, the iced tea and lemonade are also good choices.

The secret menu adds a bit of mystique and makes for great articles all over the internet. And at times you almost feel like you're in an exclusive club when you order your fries 'Animal Style' or get a Neopolitan shake and the tourists next to you can't seem to find that verbage anywhere on the 3 item menu.

He was right as there were a ton of cabs cycling through the parking lot which made it easy to get one to drive us back to our hotel. I was ecstatic to try this place as I am a huge Five Guys fan and wanted to compare the two for myself. 

I was so disappointed. When I order a hamburger, I am looking for something that I know is detrimental to my health. It's a hamburger! The burgers at Five Guys are greasy as hell and give me a stomach ache after I consume one. I ordered the animal here and it honestly just seemed too healthy to me. It was good but it didn't satisfy that burger craving.

All fast food burgers are seen through the prism of Five Guys, so, with that in mind, I tried the basic, no frills, no quasi-secret menu hamburger, fries and chocolate shake.

The verdict:  not bad...not bad at all.  I'm still a Five Guys fanatic...there are times I would kill for a double with fried onions, jalapeños, relish and mustard...mmmmm...sorry, slipping into food fugue state...stay focused...

The burger was tasty and moist, the toppings and bun fresh.  The fries were okay (The use of peanut oil for Five Guys fries really sets them apart) and the shake, while good, wasn't up the standards of another fast food franchise, Carl's Jr.  

While my love - perhaps even unholy lust - for Five Guys (insert joke here...I'm not doing all the work for you) has not been shaken, In-N-Out makes a respectable burger and will be getting my business again.  Like the most satisfying fast food places - Five Guys, Canes - they focus on doing one thing - burgers - and doing it well.

Then I remembered I was a vegetarian for 3 of the 4 years I lived in Las Vegas. No problem, the off -menu grilled cheese (FYI, I had heard that they used to avoid cross contamination, but I believe they now have to make the grilled cheese on the same griddle as the meat - so keep that in mind if you're hard-core) is always a good simulacrum of In-n-Out goodness for vegetarians. The oozing melted cheese slices fondling the intricate crevasse created by the folds of the crisp lettuce and a layer of fresh piquant onions with that freshly sliced tomato and special sauce. Mmmmmm.......

Agreed. This is hands down one of the best fast food chain burger joints out there with everything made fresh to order. This ain't no Mickey D's!

Avoid this place during the lunch rush - esp. when UNLV's in session. Otherwise, it's best when you arrive a bit earlier (11am) or later in the afternoon (after 2pm). Also good after you've been trolling down Maryland Pkwy and the local bars across the street and just need something to soak up the ethanol (C&A, Freaking Frog, Yayo's, etc.)!",0,v2C4S11PHzLEXKeF5kvTJA

I was staying at the Mandalay Bay, and i heard from people that it's walkable, but it was so hot (May '09) i didnt want to melt to death on my way there and not taste those amazing animal style fries before i die, so i took a cab. Got on the cab, didnt want to risk the cab driver driving away or keep the meter running, so we went through the drive thru and drove right back to the hotel. I dont think the round trip was more than $15, might have even been like $10. Either way, it was worth it. 

My usual is double double animal style with animal style fries. At first i thought that the animal style fries would be over doing it, but i have to say if there is one bad thing about In-N-Out is their fries, kinda plain.

Took the RTC bus 201 on Tropicana Rd.  Took us across the high way.  In-N-Out is right there.  Cannot miss it.  Convenient.  

The burgers were yummy.  Fries were a little bit different, but its a good different.  Fries were cut thinly like McDonald's. They were crispy, but not greasy. There is a nice texture to it.  Its made fresh from Idaho potatoes.  
Overall, In-N-Out reminds me of 5 guys.  Fast food joints that specialized in burgers.  So, if you are craving for CHEAP, but GOOD burgers go to In-N-Out.  

This place is SUPER popular.  There were TWO long lines that snaked around the restaurant.  One line is to order.  The other is to wait for the food.  The Drive-Thru line wasn't any better.  Cars were lined up and waiting for their food.  Wow!! 

Customers waited calmly and patiently for their food.  No one argued or acted out.  Usually, people get testy when they have to wait for their food. Phenomenal!!

I Love The Tropicana Location For 2 Reasons....The First Being The Staff Is Totally Fun and Helpful....and The Second and Deciding Vote Is B/c The Staff Is TOTALLY SMOKING HOT!!   :-)  Why Lie?  It's Yelp??!!  All In and Out Have Great Customer Service....But Not All Have A SMOKING HOT STAFF......

Being from Seattle, I pray every night that they will build one down here. The bun itself is spectacular, best fast food bun I have had. The party is charbroiled and seasoned to perfection. I love how the veggies are so fresh, as defiantly get it animal style. More than worth the price. One double double is under $4, I WAS BASICALLY ROBBING THEM. I have had sit down burgers that don't even compare to this. The fries weren't so great, but it still gets 5 stars because the burger is that GREAT, and the food overall was pretty cheap, and I am dreaming of the next time I get to eat in and out again, absolutely delicious.",0,LSAARhVDIonSYPPC5HewQw

But, their animal style fries are ridiculously worth the hype. I really recommend giving these a try. Regular fries are alright, I usually order them well done.

I was quite mad that they forgot about my order to the point where I had to go up to them and remind them about it, but mistakes happen, and the people who work there are extremely kind and charming. And once again, you can't go wrong with the prices. For a double double, animal style fries, and a milkshake, I spent about $11. At Shake Shack, one specialty burger is already $10.

There were about 6 people in line when we got in and the line wrapped around the store by the time we got our food. There has to be some reason behind this, right? Time to find out..

I never discussed this place with anyone, but for some reason ""double double animal style"" was implanted in my head from somewhere.. o_0 so I ordered whatever it was, along with a side of fries. 

The burger consisted of cheese, grilled onions, pickles, tartar sauce(? or some type of sauce), and two patties. Them patties are thin! Man, the pics on the menu are deceiving. They make the burger look so juicy, succulent, and filling! The fries I could've done without. They were bland and the texture reminded me of styrofoam, of which my sister confirmed.  

All in all, the burger was alright.. nothing spectacular. Personally, I'd prefer Five Guys or Smashburger over this. Hmm, service was decent and efficient, so our orders weren't screwed up which is a plus (yay!).",0,74MEs3l1jQTaBPpOgv8t7w

Nothing about the burger technically is that different from other chains but the quality of the ingredients and the simple menu is what elevates it above other places.  I like how the bun is not a cheap tasteless dry pre-packaged product but works well to round out the burger.

Nach dem obligaten Shoppen war uns nach einer guten, amerikanischen Mahlzeit. Sie fragte uns, ob wir In-n-out Burger kennen würden. Wir verneinten und meinten, Burger Läden gäbe es doch genug. Wir haben später verstanden warum wir da extra hingefahren sind:
Es ist eine kleine Fast Food Kette die nur in Kalifornien, Nevada, Utah und Arizona auftritt. Alles in privater Hand, kein Franchising. Es gibt eigentlich nur Cheeseburger und Hamburger - auch als Doppeldecker, dazu Pommes und ein kleine Auswahl an Shakes und Softdrinks. Das war's. Allerdings wird alles frisch gemacht: die Fritten werden aus Kartoffeln vor Ort geschnitten, der Salat vor Ort portioniert, das Fleisch vor Ort aus frischem (nicht gefrorenem) Fleisch durchgedreht usw. Jeder Burger wird frisch gemacht. Und wenn man drei Scheiben Gurke aber keine Tomate und drei Tropefen von einer speziellen Soße haben möchte machen sie das auch. Und wenn man keine Brötchen mag, dann packen sie den Burger in Eisbergsalat Blätter ein und nennen es Animal Style - Burger. Die Variationen sind schier unmöglich. Nach kurzer Wartezeit wird dann die Kassenzettel Nummer aufgerufen und das köstliche Fast Food kann am Counter abheolt werden.

While other fast food joints water down their menu with a jack-of-all-trades approach, In-N-Out sticks with a small menu of items they've perfected. The only thing I've seen them add is coffee, a Kona blend that's very similar to what's offered at Jack in the Box. That's where similarities end. When the economy slides down another notch, their prices only go up by a couple pennies. McDonalds and Taco Bell hold no qualms about jacking up stuff 35-65% whenever they feel like people aren't paying enough for the egg on their McMuffin or the Fritos in their burritos. And In-N-Out doesn't water down their drinks. If anything, they intensify the syrup and blast it with extra carbon dioxide so that the bubbles furiously retain their presence. And the water tastes clean, an amazing feat in fast food around here.

All items are fresh and trucked in regularly. I don't even think they have a freezer, because nothing is frozen. The meat is always cooked medium-well, with the slightest sliver of pink remaining in the middle, just enough to retain extra flavor while still being completely hot. Vegetables are ice cold, which can be potentially problematic if your burger sits for a long time without being eaten. Best to attack that thing as soon as you get it, because nothing compares to the bliss of a freshly prepared burger at this place. And never does it sit under a heat lamp. As soon as it's done, it's in your hand.

A standard Double Double contains two 1/8 lb patties. This is typically enough, despite a culture that expects our burgers to weigh as much as a human brain. Considering this is more meat (and better meat) than a Big Mac, I don't see the problem. But if you really want more, they do this weird thing there where they put as many patties as you want. Considering the burgers are fully customizable, from the number of patties, cheese, toppings and even the inclusion/removal of the bun, it's hard to see where you can find fault with the burgers. Short of ordering it animal style, they don't even charge for extra toppings.

And speaking of animal style, there is no greater sin than animal style fries. Whenever I feel like throwing caution to the wind and indulging my inner fat kid, that small hill of cheese, sauce and fried onions is enough to bring a tear to my eye. A full meal at this place always leaves me satisfied and jovial. And while I enjoy hitting the other places every so often, never does it compare to the immaculate In-N-Out.",3,NgqVI51Fot6-bTUT6lpYow

He also made sure our table was cleaned to prevent any cross contamination.  We left there feeling at ease and will definitely return.

The thing about the burgers is that the meat is great and the buns are nicely toasted, but then things take a turn for the worse.  Upon the nicely toasted bun they spread some sort of mayonnaise based goo they refer to as ""spread"".  Unless you stop them, they will pile up onions that reek to high heaven on top of the great meat.  Your car will smell like In-N-Out for a week if you get take-out.  After such a promising start, the end product is hardly recognizable as a traditional hamburger.

Then there are the fries.  Once again, and this is very encouraging, they start with fresh cut potatoes.  Unfortunately, the put these poor potatoes through some sort of top secret process that turns them into cardboard within 15 minutes after they go into your take-out bag.

Here's an In-N-Out dining tip.  Mercifully, In-N-Out will let you have your burger your way.  Go through the take-out, and just get a hamburger, or even a double hamburger, and the bun. Do not allow them to put anything on the burger.  The bun and the meat are the best parts of the In-N-Out burger.  Take it home and add the things you like.  If you like a good burger, you'll be very pleased.

As for the fries, here's a money saving tip.  Ask them if you can have the little cardboard tray they put the fries in.  Then when you get home, just eat the little tray.  You'll hardly notice the difference.",0,pI1mlfKEb8dbhuOuEKj4fA

If you wait in line for 30 minutes I would expect that someone would come outside and let you know their credit card machine isn't working. That way you're not stuck in line for another 30 minutes while you wait for everyone else to get food expect you. 
Also, make sure you ask them to try your card at the window, it will work 10 times out of 10. The kid at the window will make sure to tell you, with attitude, that ""if your card doesn't go through it won't mean you get free food."" My card had worked every time.

We noticed that the place was not overly advertised in the decor; its simplicity is enough to get the message across that you're here for the food and not for the decor. 

We noticed that they really do have a system in place. We saw how a team of people really gel and work together. It was welcoming to see how right they all work together and the care they take to make everything. 

We saw them slicing the potato to be cooked fresh. How the hamburgers were being built with precision. It was just amazing to see. 

The food was really good. We ordered a double cheeseburger that was really tasty. A simple touch of toasting one side of the bun gave our burger that nice crunchy taste (not too much but just enough) where others just get soggy, especially towards the end of the burger, not this place.

Had it here twice, super busy at Lunch Time.. but honestly it wasn't what I remembered. The burger was just okay. I actually didn't mind not finishing it when I had to leave quickly. Which is pretty rare for me. The food I do like I will frequent and give good business to, but after having it here twice I don't really have any desire to try it again. 

Burger seemed over cooked, and too much iceberg lettuce for my liking. Personally, on a burger I think it should be either alot of romaine lettuce or spinach, or just a little bit of iceberg. I find that when you have too much Iceberg lettuce( which has very little taste and adds nothing special to the burger) that is makes the burger have less taste, flavor, and overall makes the burger lack anything special or memorable.

Shakes are decent, but nothing to write home about, just a really basic shake with no whipped cream or any other quality touch to set it apart. It was honestly such a Meh experience. 

My Sonic burger on Sahara near the dealerships is by far much better. They make their Cheeseburgers and double cheeseburgers super good. Not alot of iceberg lettuce, fresh tomato, finely chopped onions, on a soft bun and a nicely done patty. Worth the slight wait at the drive thru.

I go and get one at Sonic whenever I crave a good burger, also for their shakes that are half off, which is a good deal for a quality shake with so many flavors to choose from.

 Sonic is surprisingly superior to In N Out for their burgers, and I'm not sure if its known for that, but I highly recommend if you want a good quality burger that's big, juicy, and tastes fresh.",1,tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g

So, we eat at In-n-Out almost every time we go there. Every location has been great. This one (and the one on Blue Diamond) are not as crowded as other locations. 

My favorite is the double-double ""animal style"", which means they put mustard on the beef while cooking, add grilled onions, extra sauce and add pickles. Pickles are not put on their burgers unless you ask for them, or order ""animal style"". When I'm really hungry I get a 3x3 'animal style', which is three patties and three slices of cheese.

I consider them very average burger joints and would actually give them 3 stars if they weren't so overhyped.  I hear so many rave reviews that I keep giving them another chance but am always disappointed.  It's kind of like going to see a blockbuster movie after reading the book.  It's never as good as you expect.  The people who haven't read the book really like the movie but it's still not the same.

Terri was the exact opposite of customer service, and they completely messed up my order despite verbally repeating it accurately back at me (the receipt mismatched with my order).

When I started making my order, Terri repeatedly interrupted me with redundant questions, which held up the already huge line behind me (the line curved into the dining area). To make matters worse, Terri scoffed at some points of my order (I was ordering a veggie burger, which is pretty common considering I'm not the only vegetarian/vegan in the world). I had to ask Terri to repeat my order, but they spoke waaay too fast. I had to ask Terri to repeat my order again at a normal pace, which held up the huge line even longer. Just when I thought this couldn't get worse, Terri literallly talked back to me when I asked for my receipt (I felt really sorry for the people waiting in line). Seriously? It's just a piece of paper. Chill.

So guess what? Despite Terri repeating my order accurately, the receipt showed a completely differently order. I had to ask for the pickles when my order was ready, and I guess Terri really didn't want me to get french fries. It's okay, I got fries from Jack-in-the-Box instead.

i was stoked to hear that a new in-n-out formed on trop and fort apache, an in-n-out less than 10 min drive from my house! (other in-n-outs i would have to drive no less than 15 min). so i decided to check this new location out yesterday. it was my first time eating in-n-out this year since i was in philly attending school. I had my fair share of descent quality fast food restaurants in philly (five guys, 500 degrees) but none of them come close to in-n-out status...whenever i would go to a fast food restaurant in philly, the in-n-out song would always play in my head...""in-n-out...IN-N-OOOUUUTTT! thats what a hammmburgers allll about!!"" thats how much i missed it...

anyways, this is what i usually get: double-double, animal style (chopped and grilled onions) with extra lettuce and tomatoes (no extra charge), fries, and a coke. if im in the mood for it, i ask for animal style fries (chopped/grilled onion and their ""special sauce"" added to the fries) and a strawberry milkshake. i also usually ask for extra spread (their packaged ""special sauce"") and chili peppers (if you like some spice to your meal). their buns are always perfectly toasted, their meat patties are always flavorful and juicy, their vegetables are always fresh and tasty, and their special sauce is to DIE for...and the fact that around $5 will get you a meal makes me think...why even think about going to another fast food joint?

if you're the type who can't read long posting like this, ill try to make it as simple as possible:
- ask me what my favorite movie of all time? I DONT KNOW
- my favorite song of all time? NO CLUE
- my favorite fast food joint of all time? EASY. IN-N-OUT

Instead of the regular fries, order the animal fries. They are covered with grilled onions, melted cheddar, and special sauce. Animal fries are excellent, but regular fries are nothing special.

You can also see how cleanly the staff is and not to mention the immaculate kitchen, of course there is never any doubt as to the cleanliness of an In-n-out...as the floors are practically clean enough to eat off of.  Of course this is a fast food restaurant and not a five star restaurant, however In-n-Out is the ""five star"" of fast food restaurants.  

Fast food doesn't get any better or fresher than this.  I moved to North Carolina back in 2010 and when ever I come back to Vegas for a visit, my first stop is an In-n-Out.",0,tGSZGnxYgnEskW3fLgJeeA

Let me start by saying I live in Seattle, WA and unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure of eating at one since they are currently only in 5 states. It's so good it almost makes you want to move to Las Vegas. I had heard about them but never investigated further. We were surprised to learn the menu consists of only about 5 items.  Yeh that's right five. Burger, cheeseburger, double burger, fries, shakes, and soda pop pretty much sums it up. The place was crazy busy with a line almost out the door both times we went but it didn't take too long to get our food, maybe 5 minutes. Everything is fresh and never frozen and they cut the fries right there in front of your eyes from fresh potatoes. The burger had a toasted bun and was amazing and the fries were even better and not greasy at all. The total bill for me and my daughter to eat was under $10 bucks. If you go at lunch or dinner expect it to be very busy. I would do just about anything to get a in & out burger in Seattle.  If you don't believe me than maybe the fact that consumer reports rated it as its top fast food burger restaurant will make you a believer.

They seem to be sticking to what they know best, yet it's apparent that they have adapted over the years to perfect their offerings. Burgers, fries, and shakes is what's on the menu. Using their ingredients, you can pretty much make any variation you want and fully customize your meal.

The secret menu isn't so secret, as it's basically a manual for how to customize the experience to your liking. I truly appreciate an establishment's willingness to cater to the customer. I myself am a vegetarian, and I look forward to the few times a year that I come across an In-n-Out.

The prices are fair. The menu is boring. The service, even when no one is in the line with you, takes forever. My group went there twice. 

The burger was decent. It was not great. It tasted just like a Wendy's burger, just slightly more fresh.

The fries, both times I got them, were bland. Basically tasteless, except for the taste of oil . I would never order those fries again. They are boring. The rest of the people with me got my fries after about the third one I tried. Maybe I should have had a few drinks at the hotel before I tried them, but sober, they are just horrible. 

It gets more than one star because you can customize and they actually listen. The sauce is pretty tasty. Other than that, I didn't see anything remarkable about it. I just like a place that actually listens to your order.


It's fast food. It tastes like fast food. When it comes to fast food, it has some of the worst fries I have ever had. The bun is standard. The meat is standard. The sauce and vegetables being fresh and tasty was what makes it just slightly better.

I haven't been to an In-N-Out since I was a teenager. It's also been a good 5 or so years since I've pretty much stopped eating fast food. With that being said, the bathing suit portion of my trip was over so I was a little excited to indulge a little.  

There was a line wrapped around the building but it didn't take more than 5 minutes to order. It probably took about 15 minutes to actually get our food. I had requested the animal sauce on the side, however they put it on my double-double anyways. I was not waiting for them to fix their mistake so just took it. I also got an order of fries. 

So it tasted like a fast food burger. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. I absolutely did. I just didn't have that east coast girl meets west coast burger euphoric experience. Although to be honest, I didn't love the animal sauce. A little too creamy/mayo-like for me. I would have preferred if my burger wasn't smothered in it.

My less than informed guess as to the fascination is because of three key reasons: (1) So many people have fond memories of eating In-N-Out as a child; (2) The ""secret"" menu and ordering makes many feel like they are privy to a secret society; (3) Those on the east coast have often only heard of this chain restaurant through office conversation, and through legends passed down by elders at night by the fire.  Oh, there might be a fourth reason; many think it is a good burger, but are afraid to take on In-N-Out fanatics by suggesting there are other equally good burgers available to our civilized society.

The burger comes with beef, crisp whole-leaf iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and thinly sliced onions with a sauce which seems to consist of  mayonnaise, ketchup and relish.  With cheese, it's only 359 calories.

The fries are made from potatoes that are peeled and diced at each store and cooked fresh in 100% trans-fat free, cholesterol-free vegetable oil.  There are no small, medium, large, or ""biggie"" options.  You just get a well-proportioned cardboard boat of fries. 

In-N-Out doesn't use heat lamps or microwaves because the burgers and fries are cooked fresh to order.  

In-N-Out is also one of those rare fast-food restaurants that make their milk shakes with real ice-cream. 

Their commitment to quality and simplicity translates into great tasting food, and also allows them to keep the prices low.  Being on a student's budget, this is one of my favorite things about In-N-Out Burger.  A hamburger is $175, with cheese it's $2.05.  An order of fries is only $1.35.  And a milkshake is just $1.95.

Another thing about In-N-Out is that there's almost always a long line of cars at the drive-thru when you arrive, but because of the distance between the ordering station and the pick-up window, you rarely have to wait long to order.  The line moves fast and your order is timed to be ready when you get to the pick-up window.  So don't let the long lines deter you.

Because of their great tasting burgers, quality ingredients, and low prices, I'm giving In-N-Out Burger the highest rating I could give to any fast-food restaurant -- 4 stars.",0,wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA

I ordered a double double with onions to go. Even though there were a lot of people waiting to order, the cashier didn't rush anything but also repeated my order to confirm they got it right. I really appreciated that. However, the line up for pick up was just ridiculous. It was chaotic: people who just ordered stood in front of the counter even though there was already a line formed. There was absolutely no order here and I literally had to push my way through to get my food. 

I enjoyed my double double. The two beef patties tasted great. The amount of the sauce was just right, it didn't make the bun all soggy and a mess to eat. It was definitely better than McDonalds. Other than that, it was nothing special. In-N-Out Burger is a great and cheap option if you are looking for a quick fix.

As for the food? Well, the burgers are pretty tasty, but Portillo's in Chicago stomps this competition for my favorite fast food burger. The toppings, like the tomatoes and lettuce are crisp and fresh, but the burger itself is thin, sad and unsubstantial. Good, but not great.

In fact, according to a recent food survey on the internet I read that it was voted the best burger joint in America. Thus my expectations were rather high when I stepped into this burger joint.

I have to admit the burger was good, marginally better than any that I've had at other fast food franchises. Perhaps it was a classic case of overly high expectations, but I wasn't blown away by the food either.

The burgers were cheap,$1.69 for a cheese burger, which along with their tasty fare is probably the reason for their success.

What you need to know about this location, is that it may be the busiest In n Out there is, and that is saying a lot because they are all busy. Being that this one is very close to the Vegas strip, you can imagine it is busy at all hours. If you want to avoid the rush, you might be able to at 10:30a when they open. That said, the location is run well like all of them, so it is well staffed and they handle the massive volumes just fine. The seating is usually full, but usually by the time your food is ready enough tables will free up that you can grab one, as long as you are paying attention. When I ate here yesterday I ended up joining another couple that was at a table of four. Not an uncommon practice at this location. Parking can also be limited, but usually not a problem.

This location is just as consistent as the rest. Clearly they follow the strict In N Out standards. I usually visit at least once when in Vegas for business.

FOOD: 5/5 stars

This has to be one of if not the best tasting fast food burger in America.  The flavors of the cheese, lettuce, sauce and hamburger work so well together and the bun is just melt in your mouth, double D delicious.  The fries actually taste like fresh cut potatoes, not that mashed together again fake fries a lot of fast food joints serve. 

my double double with animal style fries! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw?select=FT9xeB10CA3NEO03SwdIqw

PRICE: 5/5 stars

Fast food is suppose to be cheap, when you start paying over $10 for a fast food meal for a processed product that is not healthy for you, something has gone wrong with America.  In-N-Out has very cheap reasonable prices for the quality of ingredients that they use.  When you actually taste their burgers, you'll realize how much better it tastes than the big fast food american chains.  You won't be disappointed.

VARIETY: 4/5 stars

Okay so if you're looking for a chicken wrap, chicken bowl, salad, or hot dogs, etc.. LOOK ELSEWHERE.. This is not sonic with their 128,000 choices for drinks, this is In-N-Out where you come here for a damn good hamburger and fries.  What they lack in variety they make up in their secret menu.  You can take a look at the link below for a list of the secret menu, I will give my caveat here by saying i have not tried to order all the different secret menus, but if i lived in a place where i could eat In-N-Out regularly, I'd try to get them all..

INTANGIBLES: 5/5 stars

I've eaten a lot of fast food and I can honestly say that In-N-Out is the only place that I do not feel so guilty after eating a meal.  Yes it is still a burger and yes they still deep fry their potatoes but at least there are no additives in their food.  You are eating a quality product for a super cheap price.

From the cheap food to friendly service who wouldn't be?

You have two options when ordering, either drive-thru or order and sit down inside. The lines can get pretty outrageous especially during the lunch hour, so just beware. Although the line does move fairly quick, at least through the drive thru.

My first meal here, I came with a friend who used to be a local in Vegas. So lets just say he knew what he was talking about. 
I ordered a regular cheeseburger with everything on it. It was roughly $2.50. It was the perfect size and absolutely delicious. Great for a cheap lunch or dinner.

Next, my friend recommended I get the meal and upgrade the drink to a milkshake. Now, it doesn't say on the menu but you can get a neopolitan shake which is chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry mixed. I fell in love with this milkshake. A must try! 

The meal comes with fries also. Now the fries are awesome because they don't add salt automatically for you. They put packets inside the bag for you to use if you want it added. In my personal opinion I like the fries unsalted, you can actually taste the potato rather than the sodium.

I even rented a car so I could go there whenever I wanted.  The place is totally packed, but they are fast there.  The long line goes by fast and once you order, they cook your food quickly.  Which is key.  Waiting there when you see all the other people eating those amazing burgers while the smell is everywhere is torture.  

We each had two cheeseburgers and split fries and a shake. I actually prefer 2 cheeseburgers to a double double.  Thats just me in general.  I don't usually order double cheeseburgers anywhere.  Same with shake shack, I get regular cheeseburgers.   As soon as I took a burger out and bit into it, the rental car expense and the yearning was completely validated.  The bun is great, and the sauce tastes really good.  Ketchup / mayo combination?  Tastes kinda like Big Mac sauce only better.  Technically , I'm not sure how good the actual patty is - it's pretty thin and cooked throughout..but it's fast food and tastes amazing mixed with the cheese, lettuce, tomato, sauce and bun.. 

The fries are made right there when they put these potatoes through some sort of machine that slices them up, and they are delicious without being too greasy.

It just amazes me that for 2 people to eat this meal, it was like 12 bucks.  It actually depresses me that they don't have this on the east coast and I will have to wait until I go back to vegas or somewhere else out west to experience in n out again.

I don't know if they are under new management and the manager doesn't care about who he is hiring but I am completely turned off. They are rude, they can't take simple order down, and if the succeed at taking it down right then their food prep staff messes it up every single time.

We used the dine with us and again had a horrible experience. They can't get their orders correct ever. Worst In and Out and I have been to many many of them in this state and every where in California. 

I highly recommend yelping and then calling their call center. Let's get the people who shouldn't be employed out of this place.

To get here, you should stay on the side of the Excalibur hotel

Nice toasted bun, crispy lettuce, perfectly grilled onions, on top of melted cheese on a grilled meat patty. I was more blown away by it at 2AM than at 7PM the next night. The staff was very friendly and patient. They have a ketchup and hot pepper station which I loved because those are two of my favorite things to add to my burger!

Since I had no breakfast I went about 11:30am and of course there was a line starting to form already. I ordered a double double (greedy) with grilled onions and a lemonade. Sat in line for a little bit (not long) but when I made it to the first window the heffa was really rude to me. Before I could even get my card & receipt back the heffa slammed the window on me. Not that I needed anything but she was RUDE!!! Never said hello, thank you, or anything. I usually give these people a little break cuz I know we all have bad days but to customers who help you stay employed is totally unacceptable!!! Put your happy face on and suck it up you have a job to do. 

When I pulled up to the 2nd window the young lady was very nice, personable, pleasant, and didn't necessarily rush me off & slam the window on me. But that didn't make up for the heffa being rude to me initially. 

Now onto the food.....My double double was amazing as expected and just outstanding. My fries were a bit soggy but they were hot, fresh, and good. My lemonade was perfect also not watered down & I could actually taste it. Probably will go back in the future but the young lady working the first window definitely needed an attitude adjustment!!!

We all have bad days but the people you're servicing should NEVER EVER know that. When I have bad days you better believe our patients, doctors, and nurses will never know it. And the others never know unless I tell them or can sense it cuz they're around me everyday. I hate hate hate receiving bad service or feel like somebody is being rude or short with me.

My relatives promised me to make a pit stop at In-N-Out before my flight back to NYC and my heart filled with hope as we pulled up to the parking lot just to see that it wasn't opened! 

5 years later I returned to the In-N-Out in Vegas! I was a complete noob however - thinking that ordering a 2x2 animal style made me a In-N-Out insider. Boy was I wrong. When I returned a few months later I had my bombdiggity order ready:

*Well-Done animal style fries (Well done is a NECESSITY. Otherwise the fries legit become soggy messes under the special dressing + onions that look like bacon).
*Extra toasted bun (always order the bun first), medium rare animal style single w/out pickles, w/ a whole grilled onion, cut in half.
*Neapolitan Shake (Chocolate + Vanilla + Strawberry) 

The wait was minimal as it was around 10:30-11PM on a Friday night. Probably took about 10 mins for our food (it's fresh, never frozen!). My only complaint was that the bun was kinda cold :( I also could have done without the shake (suuuuuper thick).

This place is garbage. Like...I would rather have McDonald's than this any day of the week. The recommendation that I got was to order my fries wild/animal/whatever style. Apparently, this is part of their ""secret"" menu, although it's not so secret because every other person in the place had their fries this way.  

The burger tastes kind of like a sonic burger, which isn't too bad but the sauce that comes on it is horrid. And those fries... Those disgusting fries. This goop that came on the fries with a bunch of diced onions completely ruined them. 

At first, I went back up to the counter to ask for a fork to eat the fries. The place was slam packed, and the girl behind the counter was nice. The next time I went up was for ketchup... Still nice but with a mix of ""you're an annoying customer"". Whatever, I didn't care. 

I said this place was packed. The only place available to sit was at the bar style, long table. I had a front row seat to watch the kids yell out people's order numbers.

It's certainly better than McDonalds, but it's basically the same level as a Five Guys or a Steak n Shake.  Higher end (but not quite gourmet) burger places.

This location has the food that we've all grown to love from In-N-Out, so it's not that (5-stars for fast food). It's just this particular location. If you're staying on the Strip and have a car, then you can get here rather easily. If you try to walk, grab a water bottle and maybe a Cliff bar because you're in for a hike. There is a path that gets you here, but it takes forever. I wish they could have located on the Strip someplace instead. I guess you could take a cab, but then you're basically jacking up the price of your burger.

But because it's within cab distance and easy driving distance, this location is PACKED. I mean, beyond what a normal packed In-N-Out is like. This created quite the messy restaurant. Parking looked to be a disaster as well. I will say that the service was amazing, as they were churning out burgers, fries, and whatnot like a tornado - yet the quality was still there.

Will these things keep me from going to this location the next time I'm in Vegas? No, because I don't have an In-N-Out where I live and I'm not going to let that opportunity pass me by.

Let's be honest, I haven't tried every burger in the world. There might even be a better burgers elsewhere in the world that I haven't tried yet, haven't.. but would like to some day. That is always a possibility. But from here on out, I stand by what I said.

In-N-Out has been around for a long time. But while their contemporaries chose a different route, including the ones with the golden arches, to sell out to the man, In-N-Out said that people deserve quality. They deserves our BEST. That's what I'm talking about people. Creating a fresh, tasty burger, with fresh ingredients. It's not something that should be frozen and then reheated in a microwave. It's all about doing things the right way, and it shows by their massive, cult following.

Buns. I like big buns, and I cannot lie. You other brothers can't deny. In-N-Out has great buns. They don't get too squishy when you bite into them, but they aren't dry either. The meat. Never frozen. NEVER. It makes a huge difference in terms of the moistness of said patty. The cheese is underrated at In-N-Out, they use a cheese that taste like 100% dairy. And, come on. Special sauce? Yeah, I'm about that. Just pour it all over, man, all over babay. Fries? I like em well done, but that's just how I roll. Like an Animal.

You can't really beat the prices for what you pay for. The employees are really friendly. I wouldn't even take a star away if it was crazily busy all the time. I would not be able to in good conscious, considering everything that is involved.I will forever love the burgers from In-N-Out, my first one was life-changing, and my last meal will always be a Double Double, Animal Style.",19,gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w

No manager in sight so no one was directing the employees or managing the operation.

The hamburger and bun have a crispiness around the border which makes it feel like there is a party in my mouth and everyone's invited. The coke for some reason even tastes better than usual. The fries are just average and I think McDonalds has the upper hand here. But their hamburgers are awesome! 

So what about this location? The crappy thing about In-N-Out is the drive through can get RIDICULOUSLY long, but they are relatively fast. But at this location it is particularly difficult because there is a break in the line to allow cars to pass. This break causes 2 things: first is you don't know where the line begins, and second it causes some cars to crowd in front of you. Also, being in a parking lot you often block in other cars. But they do a decent job of having someone outside to take the order.

Two hours, a monorail trip and a $25 cab ride later, I simultaneously accomplished my goal and realized that if I put as much effort into realizing my dreams as I put into eating delicious hamburgers, I'd probably be a lot farther along in life.

While In-N-Out isn't my all-time favorite fast food burger (Three cheers for Five Guys Burgers and Fries!) it's still one of the best I've ever had.  Yes, I had it Animal Style.  And yes, it was delicious.  Call me a freak if you will but I would've enjoyed a little more mustard mixed into the meat.

The best parts of my In-N-Out experience were my fries and shake.  At first, I was too busy digging into my cheeseburger to notice just how light and crispy my fries were.  Even more impressive was the fact that... Brace yourself... In-N-Out's fries actually taste like potatoes!  But as good as the fries were, they barely held a candle to what might have been the best fast food milkshake I've ever had.  Before my trip to In-N-Out, I was under the impression that White Castle had the best chocolate shake around.  It's always nice to be proven wrong, especially when being proven wrong means you can give White Castle a little less credit.

For years, I've heard In-N-Out described as the Mecca of fast food.  My verdict?  While In-N-Out might not be my favorite burger joint, I enjoyed every moment of my holy pilgrimage and would gladly make it again.",0,n89fWyx196kRbDJO2Kcz_w

My negative review is a result of making a rather non-complex order and having only two vehicles ahead of me.  It was on a Saturday around 12:00 in the PM. I just want to note that the inside of place was not slammed by any stretch.  I sat there for over 10 minutes watching all the employees not move with any sense of urgency.  I thought maybe these two people ahead of me had made outlandish orders but this was not the case as I saw only one bag make it's way out the drive-thru window.

Anyone who gives it less than 5 stars should not be allowed to review restaurants. 

But now that they are on the Strip in Las Vegas, it behooves me to add yet another 5 star review in the hopes of helping fellow tourists find the best casual food option on the Strip.

In N Out is the gold standard by which all other fast food restaurants should be measured. They value their customers and not just in a lip service type of way. Their restaurants are clean, bright, and shiny. They have a staff of smiling, hustling, efficient workers who can move long lines that would have caused a catastrophic meltdown at other restaurants. They will not compromise on the quality or freshness of their product. They only have a couple items on the menu so that they can do their thing (burgers and fries) and do it exceedingly well. Their burgers are everything that people hype them up to be and more. And ""fairly priced"" doesn't even do justice to their prices because they could DOUBLE their prices and I would still go there the same amount without batting an eye.

Having grown up in San Diego, I'm no stranger to In-N-Out.  The burgers are great.  Well worth the wait for something that's truly made fresh in a fast food atmosphere.  I also love the shakes.  Too bad they're only served in one size.  Or maybe that's a good thing for my calorie count.

This particular location is always packed.  I drive home around midnight every night and I've stopped through the drive-through and it's a solid 10 minute process or more.  I'm not sure if it's a tourist thing being near the strip, but this one is slower than most.  That's saying something since most In-N-Outs are always busy.  I'd suggest the In-N-Out in the northwest part of town for faster service.

The only thing I am not impressed with are the fries.  I hardly ever get fries here.  It's a waste of time.  And of course there's the famed secret menu.  Look it up on the internets and you can find out how to get a grilled cheese and the like.  Good times.",5,On_1ZwRgD2Ry0eoKYC29iQ

You really can't beat the value (quality for price) you get from going to In-N-Out Burger, especially when compared to other Vegas eateries. Make sure to study up on the ""Secret Menu"" to prevent yourself from saying, ""That's it?"", when looking at the menu for the first time. If you only remember two words, let them be ""Animal Style"".

Good: Price and Quality. Where else in Vegas near the Strip can you get a good quality double burger, fries, and shake for around $7? The workers took their time and showed enthusiasm, which is always a bonus for fast food. Location is close to Strip. If you don't have a car you can still walk there. While it's on the North of West Tropicana Ave. past I-15, take the sidewalk on the South of W. Tropicana Ave. (Excalibur side, not NYNY side) and head West. There is a walkway that loops around the overpass and you can make it there safely via sidewalks/crosswalks. Don't forget about the store on the North side of the restaurant.

My friends and I came all the way from Philadelphia to Las Vegas for a Bachelor Party.  We stopped in In-N-Out for a bite to eat before we hit the strip.  We ended up waiting a half an hour just to eat.  This place was pack tight.  There could have been fire code violations for how crammed it was in this place.  I figured it must be good if I am waiting this long. So I waited and waited and pretty much waited some more. 

Order Numbers where all over the place. Order number 56, 48, 27, 57, 58, 69 etc.... It gets a bit frustrating when you think your next but in reality your not even close.  

Finally I got my burger and sat down with my friends hoping for a delicious bite of a juicy burger.  My first bite was pretty much my last.  Figuring to buy a double it would be big enough to fill my appetite but that wasn't the case.  The burger was fresh but not that great in a taste category.  My milk shake was the thickest milk shake in the world.  It coated my throat with a chocolaty mess, which it ended up giving me a stomachache.  

By far the best thing to order was their french fries.  They are made from real potatoes and you can watch the fri-guy put the potatoes in a contraption and cut them up.  

Other then crappy burgers and horrible milk shakes, I would hold off and not  waste your time just to get some decent fries.  Stick with paying a little extra and getting something better.

The double double is just perfect as well.  I'm not a big fan of fast food hamburgers, but I could eat these burgers several times a week!

My friend and I came here around 5:00pm.  The lines weren't too long and go by quickly, the place was packed with people waiting for their food and seats and tables were filled.

I ordered the Cheeseburger Combo (protein style), which came with fries and a medium drink.  I ordered my fries ""Animal Style,"" which is fries topped with melted cheese, sautéed chopped onions and Thousand Island Dressing.  The burger was delicious; the protein/bunless version makes it feel light and the Thousand Island Dressing adds some sweetness but complements the burger really well.  The ""Animal Style"" fries was just okay for me.  I would order the fries as is.  It's quite messy, so my friend and I asked for utensils.

Customer service was friendly and quick, despite the busyness.  I'll come back here if I'm ever craving for a burger. I have yet to try their milkshakes!

Some tips and notes: 
- They do protein/bunless burgers; it's not on the menu, you just have to ask
- ""Animal Style"" fries is on their secret menu, as my friend has told me; mention it to the cashier and they'll know what you're talking about
- They do not have utensils in the back with the condiments and napkins; you will need to ask
- Eating the ""Animal Style"" fries can be messy, make sure to ask for utensils!",6,OSDJRnAHcGrlPD59YFtxhw

I saw last October when I was in Vegas that they were opening one on the Strip, in the Linq/High Roller area, so I was very excited about that.

I was looking for more of a snack today, so the only thing I got was a hamburger, animal style. I love that they marinate it in extra sauce when you ask for that and they also add chopped onions on top. The hamburger was delicious and I wish we had this chain closer to me.

This location does lose one star for me because it didn't have any bathrooms, as far as I could tell. I had to backtrack to the Linq and find a bathroom to use after my meal, instead. Also, they need more seating, I was lucky to get a booth but a lot of people were eating outside due to the lack of seating inside.

They make your burgers just the way you want it. But they even do it for your fries. You want them animal style? No salt? You got it. How many fast food burger places do that for you with no complaints?

- Ordered a regular hamburger and french fries (classic item) as it was my first time

Really only because I've lived in states that don't have this place. People say, ""You gotta try this place!"" or ""I swear by this holy spot like some loyal worshiper!"" Um, sure.

I met up with some friends in Vegas for the Panda In-n-Out Initiation.

I pretty much stuck with the basic burger menu this time: Double-double, cheeseburger, and hamburger. I upgraded for an order of animal fries because I've always been intrigued by that. Total came to around $11.50 with tax.

Fresh vegetables are key to a burger. Check. Juicy patty? Check. Oh look, they toasted the bun! Win. The fries, as far as appearance goes, reminded me of McDonald's fries, but at least I saw the people actually placing the potatoes in the potato slicing machine. Can't beat that. All four of us still believe that there must be some type of drug in the animal sauce, because it left me wanting more burgers and fries.

A couple of my friends also got the well-done fries. That and a couple of protein burgers might be in order next time. With more animal sauce, of course.

There's a video of me eating the food. You know, just to document my initiation. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWuBDFVgK1w)

Plus, I'm pretty sure that In-N-Out makes it their business to only hire the friendliest people in the whole world. As recent transplants from NYC, we were startled and delighted by the bubbly kindness of the staff. 

As my boyfriend likes to say, in a world where there is In-N-Out, why on earth go anywhere else? It sure does kick McDonald's ass.",1,Wy1QW1iUzTYVw0jw970sUg

You will not find a quality burger cheaper than In-N-Out. When you look at the menu, it's short and to the point. One of the defining traits of this burger is the perfectly sliced onions they add. When it comes to onions, gimme the whole thing and I'll eat it like an apple! 

Nothing is frozen including the fries. The potatoes are sliced in front of you so you know you're getting fresh cut fries. Let's talk price...cheap cheap cheap! For $5 and some change, you get a combo meal. If you go for the basic single patty burger, you'll pay under $5 and that's hard to find when we're talking quality.

We couldn't believe how packed it was at 3PM. Further disbelief came from how quickly we got to order, even though I bet there was 50 people ahead of us in line. We also were blown away by how quickly we received our order. The seating is limited, but the 2 times we were there people were kind enough to budge up to free 2 seats for us, even if it meant a few parties had to mingle. All part of the fun!

And did it live up to its hype? Yeesh! We were instant fans! One nice thing about a simple menu is that a place gets really good at doing things right. We even saw them chopping up potatoes for their fries, right there at the restaurant! No bags of frozen spuds!

As a vegetarian, my go to is the Grilled Cheese ($2.30) off their not so secret menu and when I'm feeling healthy it is the Grilled Cheese, Protein Style.  The grilled cheese is not just cheese and buns but everything on a cheeseburger except the meat including secret sauce, tomatoes, lettuce, and fresh or grilled onions.  The cheese is melty with caramelized edges and the bun is soft and grilled to crisp on one side. The veggies are cool and fresh and together makes such a delicious meal. 

My husband orders the Double Double with Fried Mustard and Chopped Chilies.  This is a double meat and double cheese burger with the mustard grilled into the meat and green chilis chopped and pressed into the bun.

Of course with any other location finding a seat is a challenge. I would have more luck winning money at the slots than actually finding a seat the first time. Eventually we realized that this wasn't anti social Vancouver and that most people given the seating circumstance would be happy to share a seat with us. We found a seat with this lovely couple. Again seat sharing isn't a thing in Vancouver so we were shocked as someone actually welcomed us to their seat. I didn't do animal style this time. I just got two basic burgers and fries to share. I am happy to report that the taste is just like the location in LA. I ate that burger slowly with my eyes closed. I didn't even talk to my best friend. I just wanted the moment to myself.

But when you come to a city like Las Vegas, you just have certain expectations. Like that if you want In N Out at 5am in the morning, is it too much to ask that you be open in the city that never sleeps? Oh wait, is that New York? Well, you know what I mean.

Anyway, this place still closes at 1am, to all of our disappointment. So we decided to eat here for brunch the next morning before our drive back home. 

The ginormous neon sign off the freeway isn't hard to miss. However, I am confused that the size of this location is just like any other In N Out I've been to. The line was almost literally out the door. They are obviously busy, why not make the place bigger? It was interesting to hear people in line talk about the secret menu to their friends. Being a Californian, it's funny to think we know things others don't, like we're special or something. People ordering quadruple-stacks and animal-style fries - it gave me a new appreciation for the joint. 

It's not the best burger I've had in my lifetime, but I would have to say it is pretty darn tasty. I myself enjoy the toasted bun and the grilled onions. There was one point in my life where I would solely eat the animal-style fries for lunch for quite a few months (that's french fries with the 1000-island-like spread, melted cheese and grilled onions). And let me tell you, I was concerned for my health and had to eventually quit. 

So although I do not frequent this place too often nowadays, I realize now that I'm not sure I would like to live without it. I have heard too many a story of people who move to different states and miss the taste of an In N Out burger...and now I truly understand. 

Just be open 24 hours a day in Vegas. You are missing out on profit from post-party patrons. It just makes sense, don't you think?",1,XXCS_jLbbOvH5g0JQvey-w

Just before we left a tour bus pulled up and rushed the entryway.

So, looks like the In-N-Out Burger franchise is humming along just fine.

I ordered a hamburg and fries. It's suppose to be cooked to order so which explained why it took some time for our order to be ready.

The food is a hit or miss at this location and that's not a good thing. It so isn't that bad. I mean some times it's like OH MY GOD this is why I love In-n-Out and sometimes it's like ummmm, it's just not all that great. 

Tonight never the less was a good night. The Resturant is pretty much always busy by the way but food always seem to come out at a decent time. Tonight the buns were toasted perfectly where the edge is buttery and crunchy and the burger is juicy. The fries are the fries but this time it was not too hard and not too soft and with just the right amount of salting.

There was a good size line in the drive thru lane (not too big to where there had to be a live person outside taking curb side orders) but a size. With that said food was fresh and line moved quick. It is also nice that the drive thru is all glass and you can see them cooking inside which is entertaining and makes you forget that you are waiting when you are killing time in line. 

Anyhow I haven't yet had a bad experience with service every time have been extremely pleasant but food needs to be consistence.

Perfect menu for a straight forward or a secret menu for those who desire for more from here.
When you order drive thru, you LITERALLY get to see them prepare the food. My favorite thing to watch is how they make the French fries from the potatoes. They are always so busy so sometimes the drive thru line is way out on the main street. They are pretty good at moving the line along. There is someone outside taking orders way on advance. Makes me wonder if they ever stop working so hard. When I reach the moment of truth aka when I get my food, they are always great at asking what I need. If ONLY they actually listened sometimes. I always specify how many spreads,peppers I want. And they always seem to miss some. It's not a big deal for me but then I have to sacrifice my spread to the hubby. 
Dine in, is always hectic. People everywhere sometimes no wear to sit even outside. Mainly why I've been going drive thru for awhile. Now let's talk about parking and leaving.

To be honest I was a bit skeptical as I've eaten at a lot of burger places in my life and I hear all the time about how great some shops like In-N-Out Burger are but they rarely live up to the hype.  A good burger is a pretty rare thing, a truly fantastic burger is almost unheard of in my opinion.  So one night after a night of fun in Vegas the wife and I decided to try In-N-Out Burger finally.  We arrived late in the night, after many a drinks, and stood in a pretty long line.  Thankfully the line moved very quickly so it wasn't long before it was our turn to order.  I ordered the animal style burger and some fries and the wife got the same.  After waiting about five minutes or so our order came out.  There was a lot of people in the restaurant but we were able to find a spot.  

I was pretty impressed with just how truly tasty the burger looked in it's little container and the fries were very tasty looking as well.  It didn't take long before I ate a few of those and wow, they were really good!  Very crispy and not too oily. Very much like the king of fries: McDonalds.  I am not a ""fry guy"" so for me to like fries is almost unheard of.  Nearly everywhere aside from McDonalds I never get fries (Burger King=onion rings, Wendy's=chili, etc).  But finally it was time to actually taste the burger and I was blown away by the explosion of flavor.  The animal sauce wasn't quite like 1,000 Island or Big Mac Sauce or anything like I thought it'd taste.  It is really difficult to describe, but I will say it was delicious and I loved it.  Will definitely have to get that on the fries next time.  

So to say I love In-N-Out Burger is an understatement.  The wife loved it as well.  We honestly were tempted to go back again the next night and came very close to doing so but ultimately our desire to try some new places won out.  I sort of hope they never get these in Ohio or I may end up gaining about 10 pounds a month from pigging out on their food.

For the most part their burgers and fries taste very bland without adding a lot of salt, ketchup, and that simple Thousand Island sauce they use on the burgers. 

The beef is a very thin patty that is not all that juicy. The fries are dry and many times overcooked. The shakes taste artificial and from out of a machine. 

The cooks pour way too much salt on the burgers and fries, drowning the burgers and fries in salt.

I see nothing special about In and Out at all.

So when I was planning my very first trip to Las Vegas, this In-N-Out on the Strip was added to my to-do list.  And the hubs and I weren't going to eat there just once... we planned to go twice.  And we did!  Both times, everything was just as delicious as I remembered from L.A.

Our first visit was around 11:30 am on a Wednesday, and while the restaurant was busy, the line wasn't long yet.  Every table was occupied, but after ordering and paying, the hubs and I only had to stand around for a few minutes until a table opened up.  Most customers know not to linger after finishing their food since In-N-Outs, in general, tend to get busy and full.  As indicated by the restaurant's name, it is not the place to just sit and hang out.  If you are dining in, you don't have to ""rush,"" but please be considerate of those who are waiting for a table.

During our second visit, we got into a long line around 2 pm on a Saturday.  However, the line moved pretty quickly.  While my husband ordered and paid, I went to the dining room and waited patiently by a table that looked like they were finishing up soon.  I was delighted when the two ladies at the table asked if I'd like to use their table when they were done.  Score!

What I've had at this location:

* Cheeseburger ($3.25) - If you're not super hungry, the single patty cheeseburger is a good amount of food.  I always get my burgers with NO onions.  This simple, classic cheeseburger is seasoned perfectly with the right amount of ""spread"" (basically Thousand Island-style sauce) along with lettuce and tomato.  Every ingredient tasted fresh and delicious.
* Double-Double ($4.50) - Pretty much ditto what I said about the regular (single patty) cheeseburger, but add an extra patty and an extra slice of cheese for more food and flavor!
* Fries ($2.10) - The flavor of their not-so-greasy fries actually reminds me of potato chips!  They're somewhat light and even though they're not the best fast food fries (in my humble opinion), I still think they're tasty and pair perfectly with the amazing burgers!

I don't bother with animal-style (""secret menu"" item... ask them), protein-style (lettuce instead of buns), or any of the milkshakes.  I've always enjoyed the simple, classic items as they have consistently been good.

Overall, this In-N-Out Burger on the Las Vegas strip gets 5 stars!  Thanks to the friendly and efficient employees, convenient location on the Strip (The LINQ Promenade), and of course - the BEST fast food burgers, the hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed both of our visits to this location.

Um.  I don't know what's going on.  Their food is always legit and other than this strange, recent pattern of boxing food (I don't like that because I usually take it home and it can get cold on the way) they still taste awesome.

We barely found a place to park and once inside the scene was chaotic. All registers were opened, lines out the door and hot and irritable people all standing around waiting for their orders with no available tables to sit and enjoy their food. 

The poor cashiers were really nice but seemed tired and fatigued. I ordered but feared they would get my very simple order of a classic hamburger w/o tomatoes and fries wrong.

I even wrote a 5 star review of this place previously. After eating here the night of march 16th, I woke up the next morning and noticed some stomach cramps. by the mid afternoon the cramps got really bad. After a few hours I was puking my guts out and having extreme diarrhea. I am still not back to normal from this.

I remember when looking at the hamburger patty seeing a bit of pink, however at the time I thought it could of been a piece of tomato. Could be the patties are undercooked or who knows what could of gone wrong. Either way, after most of the puking had subsided,  I decided to stop by and tell the manager what happened so they could have a heads up in case there was a contamination or if someone was not frying the patties all the way. Talked to the manager and was totally blown off. Was told it was not possible for me to get food poisoning at In-N-Out, it was just not something that could happen there and that I must of gotten it somewhere else. 

I was not very happy that I got food poisoning, but hey, people make mistakes, I thought I would at least give them a heads up so they could eliminate future problems. I can forgive for an honest mistake. But no, I was treated like a total idiot and was given a total BS response. Absolutely no concern or effort was put forth when it comes to food safety, not even a ""Sucks that happened, I'll talk to the cooks and make sure the patties are not getting undercooked"". 

So yeah, I like their burgers, I am not so liking being food poisoned by them, I can forgive though. However I am MAD that when you bring a food safety issue to their attention they will not even admit to the possibility it could of been them or at the very least make a token effort to PREVENT possible future cases.

Shake so thick that it's really hard to suck out through my straw.... uh hem. All of this quality I can taste and it only came out to $6.38... TAKE THAT SHAKE SHACK.

Fifteen minutes of foodgasms later and I was ready to leave for the airport. 

Till next time In-N-Out, I love you and miss you already.

My personal side story:


If you are a visiting out of towner, do not do what I did. I honestly thought I was going to miss my flight because I had a cab drop me off here so I could enjoy my burger in peace. Unbeknownst to me that unlike NYC, Vegas cabs are not allowed to be hailed on the side of the road... So here I  am waiting at an In-N-Out for a cab that I called in because I could not for the life of me get any of the cabs driving by to pull over on this random road.

15 minutes passes... nothing.

I call the cab company and they said they have NO record of my request so I resubmit it.

Then another 15 minutes...

Then another 30 minutes...

At this point I have been waiting for a cab for an hour, my flight is in an hour and I am freaking the f*** out!!!

Luckily one man dropping off someone else earlier saw me and actually came back to get me. Thank you taxi man!!! Ironically enough my flight ended up being delayed TWO HOURS because of the one thunderstorm that happens once a summer in Vegas... so everything was fine.

So there, that was my full In-N-Out Burger story from Vegas. Enjoy.",11,AtZ5hAERArUCN-9L6SnoPA

The employees are always nice and friendly, just like at any other In N Out, but it's just so much better than say, the one off Dean Martin that's always packed with all the riff raff from the Strip!

Are these the best burgers in the world? Well, not really, but where else can you get two burgers and an order of fries for less than $8?

Way cheaper than McD's and your food is cooked fresh to order and you get it hot! Unlike McD's where the cheese isn't even melted 99% of the time.

I used to not be an In N Out fan, but compared to other fast food places, really how can you complain about it? You can't compare them to other $6-8 per burger joints. I mean Smashburger is right across the street, and it's good, but it's more than double the price.",3,sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg

So when I found out that there was one a couple of blocks away from the convention center I was working in, I was beyond ecstatic. I just had to get there. So I dragged two of my co-workers to In and Out to grab a ""burger and fries"". It was amazing. Out of this world. The best burger I ever had. Etc. Etc. Other than that, I really can't say much.

Having recently been to a bunch of burger places I felt I was ready to see where In-N-Out would rank. I ordered a double double animal style, fries, and a strawberry shake. Every one of those items was outstanding.

First off, the restaurant is very clean despite being completely packed. All the staff were nice and helpful, not a surly employee in sight. I was impressed at how quickly the line moved and that the wait for the food itself was short considering I was here at the height of the lunch rush.

My burger was fantastic. Extremely flavorful on its own, but in tandem with the cheese, sauce, veggies, and bun everything came alive. I think the meat patties at Shake Shack may be a *little* bit better, but the superior bun and sauce more than make up the gap for In-N-Out. The fries were perfectly cooked and the shake was the epitome of a strawberry shake.

Here's the real kicker though- the price. This is the location right by the Vegas strip. Having ordered basically the same thing at Shake Shack I was prepared for a $20 price tag. But no! It  came out to $8 and change! You simply cannot get a better deal for your money.

I had tried them years ago in LA, but had forgotten how I liked them, so got the opportunity to try them again while in Vegas for a conference with coworkers. 

It gets pretty busy but once we got our food I was excited to dig in. I got a cheeseburger animal style and cheese fries. I'm a big lover of fries and love some good cheese fries. Unfortunately these disappointed. I thought the cheese would be more of a liquid texture, like good cheese fries should be. Instead the cheese was melted hard on top of he fries so everything was stuck together and impossible to spread around. Even alone the fries just weren't good, which really sucks. The burger however was better but still nothing to write a great review about.

Being right next to UNLV I'm certain during the day and during semesters the place is slammed. But if you go during semester breaks, or later at night (the lobby is open until 1AM every night) crowds and wait times are actually surprisingly minimal. Usually no line and you get your food in only a few minutes.

1. They are open til 1am inside, which is awesome, especially after getting out of a sporting event late at night with friends.

2. A Double-Double is an American Classic and one damn good cheeseburger, nothing beats it.

3. They have the simplest menu on earth, which means the food is incredibly fresh because all they make is burgers and french fries, which happen to be the most perfect combination ever.

Yeah, it's pretty straight forward here. There is nothing better than a Double Double with a handful of their fresh cut fries washed down with a shake or ice cold Dr Pepper or Coke. Theyre open late, the food is amazing, and incredibly affordable. You can easily get meals for two people for $10. There's a reason any location you go to is always busy.

I was also upset that I don't use the word ""miffed"" anywhere near as much as it deserves to be used. So imagine my surprise and happiness when I found out that In-N-Out has an outpost in Vegas.

In case you can't imagine it, it was kind of anticlimactic in that I didn't jump around or throw midgets in celebration. I was just really happy while sitting in a moving car.

So, which is better? Subjectively, I would still say Shake Shack. The girl, however, who does not like any hamburger ever created, ate 75% of my Animal Style burger in the time it took me to take a sip of my milkshake (Neopolitan, because you have to order off the menu anytime you're given the opportunity in life).

Coming from the East Coast, In N' Out was this idolized burger business model which marketed fresh ingredients in a super paired down list and even a secret menu which gave those in the know, 'an insider elite status' (it was even brought up during class at The Hotel School...although I wouldn't call it a menu, rather a variation on existing items )  But, In N' Out has that evolutionized mystique, a cross between nostalgia, fast-food fare with that healthy, Californian fresh-food zeitgeist that dupes all of us into believing that we're eating healthy and saving the dolphins with each purchase...

With that said, the burgers, the architecture along with its core values has become a staple in the West Coast culinary landscape and it's always on the list of places we go to grab something quick and delicious, (it's really bad that there's one across the gym...)

It's a pretty simple menu, and going there is no brainer, but we like to get a couple of things different; for the burger, it's always a 2x4,  (a double double - two beef patties with extra cheese -four slices) and get it, 'Animal Style' where the patty is Mustard Grilled, with Grilled Onions, Thousand Island Dressing and Extra Pickles.  You can ask for the Burger to be, 'Medium Rare' for it be pink in the middle, (sometimes well done can be too tough for me) all in all, it's got great flavor and the Beef shines through above all the condiments....

For the Fries, it's got to be, 'well done' (cooked until they're extra crispy).  I don't know, but maybe because they cut the fries fresh, they can be chewy/soggy so when you order well done, they come out crunchier.  on top of that, we order them, 'Animal Style' as well; that's with Melted Cheese with Grilled Onions and Thousand Island Dressing on top.  You have to eat it with a fork and it's decadent!!! Wash it down with a Root Beer Float, (Root Beer with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Creams) and you're back in the 50's, beeboping to the jukebox after school with girls in hoop skirts and neckerchiefs swung to the side!!!!

In fact, I feel like having In N' Out right now.... gotta run!!!!

The burgers are OK.  Largely flavorless but well cooked and with fresh veggies. 
The fries really aren't good at all.  They taste a bit like the really crappy old Wendy's fries.

Guys...it's In-N-Out. When can you ever go wrong with In-N-Out? If you're an East Coaster like me, you know that In-N-Out is the holy grail of West Coast dining and thus you must make a pilgrimage to the nearest In-N-Out location whenever you find yourself within close proximity.

This most recent trip to In-N-Out was a more special occasion because my friend who was traveling with me had never been before. It was exciting to me a part of her first experience and, of course, she loved it. Especially the Animal Style fries.

Or let's just say, it was OK, but definitely no WOW, not much taste to it or anything to write home about nor warrant another visit anytime soon. Though, I will say, for the price and for being fast-food, it's one of the better burgers on the market. But would say, it ranks right in line with Shake Shack burgers, but cheaper.

The service was of descent speed,  and the food was ok.  I am used to eating majority clean foods, so it made my tum tum hurt a bit, but it was tasty! 
I accompanied my burger with a chocolate milkshake, & fries,  I think they literally grab a potato, slice it into fry shape, and fry it up fresh on the spot just for your order... maybe, I think that's similar to how their process works.
I didn't get any soda or beverage but the pink lemonade actually did look appealing,  perhaps if I go back again I shall give it a try. 
They have ample seating indoors and an outdoor patio with some sunny spots and some shady spots.  The indoor area has booths and tables, which are handicap accessible.

As Joyce W. knows, I've been living under a rock for some time now apparently, because I have never been to an In-N-Out Burger before. So while in Vegas traveling with a bunch of crazy cousins, we came here for lunch on the second to the last day of my vacation.

I got a Double Double which is basically a double cheeseburger with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and ketchup. I also got the Animal Style Fries that people have told me is a ""must try"". It had melted cheese, carmelized onions, and what I think is, Thousand Island dressing on it. Nothing worth ordering a second time.

The fries, by the way, suck. With or without all the stuff on it, they weren't crispy and it was boring and lame. My cousin said that I should have asked for it ""well done"". Why? To me, just make it one way. With a nice amount of crispiness on the outside. 

Lastly, the burger was a little too salty for my liking, but I guess for about four bucks, I really can't complain. This location is right next to UNLV, so if you're a student on a budget, this place is for you.

My favorites:

Neapolitan Shake- vanilla, chocolate and strawberry coarsely mixed and it is truly a pleasure. No fruit chunks in the strawberry either.

Animal Style Fries- don't be a fatty, share. Loaded with spread, grilled onions and a slice cheese you will need a fork and a wet nap. We usually get these and a regular fries to offset the guilt.

Double-double Protein Style- sure the bun is good, but you know what's better? Tons of thick, crisp lettuce that doubles as a ""burger cup"" if you will. I go light on the onions because if you don't it's way too much. The cheese oozes all over. If you have no dignity you can eat large chucks off the wrapper. My husband calls it ""cheese paper.""

Now if you get regular fries you have to ask for the spread when you pick up your order. Get a condiment cup from the napkin station and DIP DAT!

If you 're craving some In-N-Out and don't wanna wait too long at the always crowded Tropicana location definitely hit up this locations.  It is only a few miles south and you're basically In-N-Out as you should.  No 50 or so taxis, limos, or drunks pedestrians in your way. The main reason for the review.  Because this is located in a shopping center there are lots of parking spots to dine in your car, which the Tropicana location lacks when busy.

My west coast friends would constantly rave to me about the juicy cheeseburgers and amazing animal style fries that I had to try. As such, those were the things I ordered. Here's what I found...

Pros
- Lines were long but orders came flying out 
- Service: Although a fast food chain, workers smiled and someone even came to clean up our plates 
- Price: The best part. Two ""cheeseburgers"" (animal style is free) and animal fries (not free - surcharge of $2) for $11. Not a bad deal to get you full 

Cons
- Fries were soggy. Even the ones at the bottom not soaked in cheese were soggy :( 
- Burger was good but not great. Lettuce and tomatoes were fresh but the patty was very thin. Bun was the saving grace. Maybe getting a 2x2 or 3x3 would've helped. 


Overall: The food was definitely better than McDonalds but I'd prefer five guys or even shake shack. Five guys because their fries are much crispier and burgers can be customized with many more toppings. Shake shake while more expensive, has a better beef patty and much better tasting fries.

Insert copulatory motion joke here, if you must, but In-N-Out is more than just another euphemism for ""the motion of the ocean.""

It's the best damn hamburger joint on the West Coast. Period. End of sentence. 

The ""double-double animal style"" with extra mayo and fresh cut fries cost under $6 and yet are a better meal in my mind than meals I've had in LV for 20 times the price. 

The fries are hot and crisp, but not hard. They are flaky and steamy starchy salty sticks sent from a loving New Testament kind of God.

I'm from Florida so the closest thing we have to IN-N-OUT is Five Guys or Shake Shack, so let me just say that IN-N-OUT exceeded my expectations!

I have been dying to try IN-N-OUT since the celebrities I follow on social media are always getting it. So I was excited to know that I had one right next to my hotel on the strip. When I first arrived to Las Vegas I checked in to my hotel and went straight to eat. The lines were really long but they move extremely fast and make sure you pay attention to your meal number as they don't go in order.

I got the cheeseburger meal with a vanilla shake and OMG it was to die for! I love how crispy the bun was from them toasting it and how packed my burger came but not sloppy at all. I hate have to bite into a burger and all the ingredients are falling out because it was overstuffed and everything becomes a mess. With this burger it was no problem. The milkshake was thick and creamy. The animal fries were fantastic!!!

I went about 5 times during my 3 day stay because it was the only fairly priced meal on the strip that was worth what you pay! Only problem I had was the attack of pigeons in the outside seating area that never left your side lol. But I demolished my food quickly so it wasn't a bother.

I'm here to tell you that it's that good. And then some. 

I'll spare you the rundown on what INO is all about - the ""AxB"", the ""secret menu"", fries cooked to order, Animal Style -  you can use the Googles for that. I'm just going to tell you that a Double Double Animal Style is perhaps the most delicious burger in America, and the Animal Style Fries are gratuitous, glutenous goodness. 

One thing to note is that while INO seems like ""fast food"", it is anything but. Food is cooked to order, and combine that with it's popularity and frequent long lines means a wait for your burgers. But that wait is SO worth it. In-N-Out was a must stop for me every time I went to California for my last job, but it had been about 5 years since I had an INO experience.

I have to admit I was very skeptical at first but when I saw the massive cue in the drive thru and inside, I thought to myself this place must be pretty good. I felt kind of ridiculous standing in line, wasting my time waiting for a burger, but the people watching was interesting. Random obese men with back and kidney tits breathing heavily and scratching and sniffing like junkies waiting for a fix. People openly drinking beer in public. Some had mullets. Others did not.

 I finally got my order. A cheeseburger combo. It just looked like any old random fast food burger except it was wrapped a little nicer and the person who handed it to me had a smile. I opened it up to inspect what was inside and it had the florescent yellow processed cheese square, a slice of tomato, lettuce, some beige goo and a pathetic lumpy brown disc that resembled beef. Took one bite and decided to give the fries a chance. They were bland, but when salted or smothered in catsup, they tasted much better. Since it was so cheap, instead of polluting my body any further i decided to just trash the whole lot. I was paying for the experience not the food. This is a biased review because I didn't stumble in here drunk. I think that's where all the 5*'s came from. 

On a side note these were the happiest fast food employees I've ever seen.

I'm not a big fan of cheese on my burgers (besides, there's enough on the animal style fries!), so I got a double meat, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they actually charged me less than a double-double would have been. So they actually do subtract out the cost of the cheese. Score!

This finally came to fruition after walking about two miles and then also almost getting hit by a car (apparently crosswalks mean nothing in Vegas).

I had the double double, animal style, with fries, animal style and a lemonade. Absolutely amazing. The burgers were so much better than anticipated. I was so glad I finally got to try it. It sucks so hard there are none back here in Chicago. The animal style really adds a lot of flavor to an already very tasty burger. The wait was a bit long, though there were a ton of people in there. It has a very '50s atmosphere that brings a little bit extra awesome to eating at boring old fast food places.

GIRL:  Really? I don't really like burgers, do you have anything else?
EMPLOYEE: (controlling a smirk) No. I'm sorry, just what's on the menu.

EMPLOYEE:  Oh I'm really sorry we don't have bacon or avocado.
GIRL: (Turns to boyfriend) Just order me something, this place is stupid! (Walks out of line and plops down in a booth with arms crossed.)

It doesn't have all the crowds and as with many other locations, the customers flow well, so there isn't really a problem finding a seat. Even if you have a large group.

The best thing about In-n-Out is their basic menu. Burger, fries, and a drink. The product sells itself. Of course I like their burger, but my favorite is their fries. How do they get them so light and airy?

Yes, they are much better then most of the food you can get in Vegas, but I just cant understand why people seem to like them..there is nothing particularly special about a large greasy burger with the gimmick of putting as many patties on it as you want.

My parents used to own a business right down the street off of tropicana I believe and coming from green valley wed drive by this place all the time..and every once in a while wed stop by. As a kid i didnt like it that much..but then coming back when i was in my 20's to party in Vegas i tried it again and realized just how bad it is.

- Fresh Ingredients
- Lightly Toasted Buttered Buns
- Creamy Shakes. If you don't mind mixing flavors, try their Neapolitan shake. It's not listed in their store menu b/c its a ""secret.""
- Extremely AFFORDABLE! 
- Double-Double Animal Style. You won't see this on the menu board either. This is off their ""Secret Menu.""
- Fast and Friendly Cashiers
- Yummy Pink Lemonade


Whats ""OK"" about IN-N-OUT:

- Mediocre Fries. A fellow Yelper, Ben G mentioned ""they get cold very quickly."" I completely agree.
- Thin (but tasty) Meat Patties


I love Shake Shack for many reasons. It is definitely pricier than In-N-Out, but for the quality and deliciousness, its worth it. Eventhough Shake Shack's fries are just OK, I like their fries better than the ones at In-N-Out. The meat patty at Shake Shack is also thicker and juicier. 

Question: Would I visit IN-N-OUT or Shake Shack more if they (in my dreams) opened side by side?

Answer: IN-N-OUT. You get the same high quality ingredients (yes, a thinner meat patty), but you don't have to fork out as much cash! I can do without fries. 

This was so worth the walk from the strip (which was NOT bad at all).

{Note} It's packed in here, but people eat quite fast. You should be able to find a seat inside soon enough. If you're going in a big group, it may be quicker for you to find seats outside. 

{Tip} Their ""Secret Menu"" is really not a secret. Go on their website, click on Menu and you will see a tiny folder labeled ""NOT-SO-SECRET-MENU."" Now you're in the loop :D",26,dHxvSPU6PZqX1LQRXajGDQ

After a delayed flight, plummeting blood sugar, a mile-long line & a mini melt down at the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center, I was ready to fight somebody for my first ever In-N-Out meal! I've forever heard & read about these legendary West Coast burgers & fries that we Midwesterners are not so privileged to have, but I wanted to try them first hand to see if they are worth the fuss.

1st stop after the rental car nightmare: a mad beeline to the popular Sin City In-N-Out location on Dean Martin Drive near the Strip where I had my very 1st I&O experience! I first noticed all the lovely, adorable palm trees (my fave) by the building & loved them! No palm trees in the mighty Midwest either :-(

I already knew about the cult ""secret menu"" & had my order planned out forever ago! I got a double-double, protein, gem-modified, animal-style: 2 mustard-griddled patties, lettuce-wrapped with cheese, mustard, tomatoes & pickles but held the extra spread & grilled onions. I also got a regular order of french fries & a regular, black coffee because I was exhausted from traveling. 

I always order lettuce-wrapped burgers at restaurants when the option is available like at Five Guys or Red Robin, etc. When I got
my meal, I inspected it & it looked like fast food artwork, beautiful! (see my pics)

The menu says their french fries are fresh cut, but they kinda reminded me of McD's fries only a lil thicker with a perfect amount of crispiness & have some potato-like, looking edges. They are completely different than the darker/limper/potatoey/natural-looking, hand-cut 5 Guys kinda fry that I love, but these fries are really friggin' good too, 4 gems!

My 2 burgers were nicely wrapped with fresh, sliced tomatoes & dill pickles in one large, solid, crisp piece of leaf lettuce with cheese & mustard oozing out of every insanely, tasty bite! That's right, it's messier but OMG more flavorful & juicy than, smh, Five Guys! I never polished a burger, let alone a damn double off that quick in my entire life! I was in burger paradise & still dreamin' about it, um 5 gems!

This I&O is bright, large, & very clean. For those of you unfortunate enough to have never dined at I&O, you place your order at the counter, your food is made fresh to order, you get a number & they call out your number when your order is ready to pick up at the counter. The staff here was friendly, the place was busy & it took about 15 min to get my food, not so fast but definitely worth the wait! Burgers at 5 Guys are never gonna be the same :-(

A lady next to me was eating food from Wendy's, and I didn't even try to hide my disapproving look! How the hell do you eat Wendy's at I&O, the audacity of some people! That's like going to Lou Malnati's in Chicago & bringing in Pizza Hut! I wanted to scream, I don't have I&O by me you ungrateful woman!!

I&O doesn't have free peanuts or all the extra free toppings like 5 Guys. But what they do offer & make are straightforward, kick-ass tasting burgers that don't need all the extra goodies, they have a really cool marketing edge aka ""the secret menu"" & bonus they sell coffee that ain't too bad either! I now get the I&O madness over these gemazing, Wild West burgers!

I came, I saw, I was In (I devoured), I was Out!! Now, I may just be inclined to catch a redeye to Megas the next time I get a craving, cuz I would do anything for...Good Food!",48,tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q

Day in and day out, they constantly serve you great effing food for a great price. It's one of those good quality fast food that never ever loses its luster. 

Double-double animal style, should be what's in your mind if it's your first time coming through those doors. Make sure you're ready for a bit of a wait, because the lines here almost never ever diminishes. Pick a parking spot, watch your ticket number, and if they call it,, prepare for destruction.

The burgers are very good, I heard even just the cheese burger without the animal style sauce is state of the art. Fries are good as well, and please make it animal style as well. Trust me, you want that to happen. Hence the term, Double-double animal style. 

It's a given that at any west coast destination, upon exiting the airport, make a direct trip to the nearest In-N-Out shop. It's probably a time honored tradition,, as far as I'm concerned at least.

I love you In-N-Out! I'll see you again next time. That's for real.

Being an East Coaster, I often dream about stuffing down a double double, but cannot so whenever I get the chance, I stop in. The Las Vegas location is no different than any other West Coast location, besides being larger than the average. The staff is super friendly and you can tell they are trying their hardest to move everything along as fast as possible without sacrificing quality.

Docking a star for ordering and food wait time. Not really unique to this location, but it was packed and we were lucky to snag a table (which was dirty). The sign outside says 'no delay' which is misleading as it took us ten minutes to get through the line and another fifteen for our food. I wish the hours were expanded a bit later than 1 AM. I can tell you that this place would see business at any hour of the day if they were open 24 hours, not sure why that isn't a thing since the Starbucks next door can pull it off.

My only complaints were the fries and the lack of seating for larger parties. Fries did not seem fresh, lacked crunch and flavor. The place is not large so seating is limited and saw families and sports teams  not able to sit together.

The meal portions are appropriate, leaving you satisfied without the gluttonous guilt of McD's, Carl's Jr, or Fatburger.  This particular In-N-Out is very busy since it is right off the Vegas strip.  The drive-thru queue runs 10+ cars at peak hours.  Dine-in orders usually take ~10 minutes.  All of your food is cooked fresh, from non-frozen ingredients. 

My order: #2, animal style
Includes: Single patty cheeseburger, french fries, medium fountain drink
Total Price: $4.70

(3) veggie sandwich - no meat, no cheese

I've had great experiences along with a few mediocre experiences throughout the many years I've been eating at In-N-Out. The bottom line is they win more than loose and based upon that they're a first round HOF (hall of fame) nominee.

Other 'burger joints claim you can have it your way. But can you really?  This time around got the Double-double with grilled onions and chopped peppers, hold the lettuce & tomato. A grilled cheese. That's right!  Give me a cheeseburger, hold the burger, with tomatoes and onion. My way all the way! Top it off with fresh French fries, Coke and vanilla shake and you have a little piece of nirvana served in a small red plastic tray. 

Lastly, at $12 for all that food In-N-Out blows away the new-to-the-west coast ""quality"" burger joints and their inflated prices.

I had never seen a fast food restaurant so busy. The lines moved fast and there were always a steady line of people coming and going. They even had taxis stopping by there to drop off and pick up waiting customers.

Yes there is none in Hawaii but if we had one, they would know my name as I would be going there often.  I travel to California and Las Vegas every year for the past 14 years and for the past 10 years I have been eating here at least once every single time.  Yes I truly love this burger, the place (nice and bright and clean), the people (they are always smiling and up-beat and is willing to please), and there is always one some where that I can pull up to and get my fix on.

With all that said, I will get into the nitty gritty about this place as most people know that they have a great burger, shake, and fries.  What I am about to write is what I know and have ordered at one time or another just to see which way I like best ( so far I liked them all ).  Yes, what I'm talking about is their secret menu.  Secret menu?  Yes, they have a menu off the menu you see.  It's so that the normal person won't hold up that already long line trying to figure out what you want.  Kind of like Starbucks and all the different ways to order your drinks.  Wait, you didn't know about that too?  Oh boy, that's for another review.  LOL

Ok the buns here come toasted and burgers are done medium-well.  But you can request that your bun come either no toast or extra toasted.  Make everyone that didn't know you could do it this way and say the two magic words... Medium rare and whoop there it is, a nice pink center that most don't see as they didn't know you could get it this way.

Besides the single and double, you can ask for a THREE BY THREE or FOUR BY FOUR.  Yup you guessed it.... You will get a triple or quadruple cheeseburger.  Before, one could order up to a 100 by 100.  Unfortunately, that is a thing of the past. 

What, you like extra condiments on your burger... No problem as you can get extra for any burger (example for extra mustard) by asking mustard grilled. What the cook will do is put extra mustard on the top of the patty before flipping it so that the flavor soaks into the meat.  Oh yeah!  I'm sure some of you cooks out there is going to try this at home.  

I'm sure here and there you will hear someone ask for ANIMAL STYLE (you can get this with almost any burger).  Animal Style is grilled onions cooked in the delicious meat juices which is combined with extra Thousand Island sauce, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. (btw this is my favorite at the moment but I also add raw onion, yes you can have both)  What, you're feeling that you want that delicious grilled onions and Thousand Island Sauce on your fries.  YES PLEASE, you can do it by ordering Animal Style fries.  YUMMY!

So, you are on a no carb diet!  No problem, you can ask for PROTEIN STYLE.  That's right no buns but you get your burger wrapped in lettuce.  

Some Monkish people prefer to keep their rabbit food and carnivore-ish food separate.  If this is you, you can do this by ordering a SALAD ON THE SIDE.  If the employee is a newbie and doesnt know how to do this, then you can ask for extra lettuce, tomatoes, and if you want onions on the side.  To be really sneaky and get the most out of it, you can also ask for an extra packet of spread and BOOM you got yourself your own side salad at no extra cost.

Now we come to the FLYING DUTCHMAN. This is for all those who are looking for something Mr. Atkins would come out of his grave and give his stamp of approval.  Two slices of melted cheese between two burger patties.  No bunny food, no carb loading buns, just pure protein.  You could do animal style with this as well but they will but they will put the onions with the cheese but the Thousand Island Sauce and pickles on the side as it would be too messy and get all over you unless that's your thing.  Hey some of you are strange individuals.   

You have a friend, (we all have that one friend who is vegan or vegetarian. Yes there is a difference) no problem.  Just ask for the GRILLED CHEESE.  You will get a toasted bun with two slices of American cheese melted perfectly between the two buns.  If you want you can even ask to get the standard lettuce, tomato, and raw onions inside.

I like In-N-Out fries but I LOVE McDonald's fries better.  If you are like me, you can order your fries differently as well.  If you want them extra crispy, just say, WELL DONE.  The fries will come out more dry and crunchy. If you like opposite 180 then ask for LIGHT and you will get that limp and oily and just add salt and there you go.  Some like the TWO MINUTE fries which is still crunchy and a little raw in the middle.

Last but not least is the shake and floats.  You have the standard choice of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes.  What you want all three?  You got it!  Ask for the NEAPOLITAN.  So you want to wolf down a nice cold one without struggling to suck out the goodness?!?!?!  Then try ask for the ROOT BEER FLOAT.  You will get a half cup of root beer topped with a swirl of vanilla soft-serve",14,ETt5294q4Xm1ZB8EX28Ejw

I tried the burger and was unimpressed.  The burger patty is so thin compared to the toppings and the bun.  Bread with a side of meat?  Yea, pretty much.  The grilled onions really added flavor to the burger though.  

The fries were so heavy.  Thick cheese and sauce and onions.  Again, the onions made it better until the cheese congealed and was really goopy.

All in all, everything that you would expect from an In and Out. Fairly clean, and quick service. Burgers were extremely tasty as usual and they have indoor and outdoor seating.

In N Out Burger is hands down the best cheeseburger I had ever eaten in my life. When we went to Vegas 2 years ago, I had my first In N Out Burger. We went to L.A. last summer, we got off the plane, got our luggage, got the rental car and proceeded directly to In N Out Burger @ The 405 and Inglewood Avenue. 

They can make a burger as big as a 4x4, I got the 3x3 myself with well done cheese fries. The fries are decent, I know a lot of people don't care for them, but the burgers are the best you will ever have. 

The location in this review is nice and convenient, its a short walk from New York New York right down Tropicana Ave under I-15. They also have a company store, which we bought some mugs and T-shirts at after lunch.

I always recommend In N Out to friends going to Vegas or Cali.

The crispy bun complimenting the cool lettuce, the special sauce accentuating the fresh tomato, the sweet meat mixing with the salty cheese, all of it coming together in a harmonious medley of flavor thus far unseen on the American fast food landscape - I was smitten. It was the single greatest fast food meal in the history of civilization. Even though I was full, I immediately ate another Double-Double. I was nearly in tears at this meal, it was so transcendently excellent. Those #*&!@'s should hire me as a spokesman.""

I usually get a #2. Cheeseburger no onions, animal style fries no onions. But last visit I decided to be crazy and keep the onions on the fries. Bad idea! My fries tasted like sh**. I have started to acquire the taste for onions but In N Out grilled onions are disgusting! I will stick to ""No onions please"". 

They have a secret menu. Part of that is animal style fries. They also have protein burgers, grilled cheese, and some other fun secretive items that I can't remember.

Everything is made in-house. They literally put the spud in the slicer in front of you! The milkshakes are the creamiest milkshakes I've ever had so this definitely was the highlight of my night!!

The burgers are overly salty. Saltier than I am when I'm trying to get my revenge on the person that cut me in traffic. The fries, although are perfectly made, are not perfectly seasoned.

In my opinion the buns you get on a regular hamburger isn't going to mess up your carb macro too much.

I think it's crazy that we almost take the In-N-Out burger for granted.  I am positive if I moved somewhere that doesn't have this place I would probably be clinically depressed.  OK, maybe not that sad, but pretty sad.  

In-N-Out burger is all about the secret menu.  Secret menu you ask?  I am talking animal style!  What is animal style?  It's a mustard-cooked patty with additional pickles, cheese, spread and grilled onions diced up and mixed together on the grill before getting dumped on your burger.  Yes it's pretty much the most awesome burger ever.  I also get chopped chilies on my burger.  This will put some extra kick on you burger.  Don't forget to get a double double or if you are feeling adventurous then go for the 3X3.  

What's great about the IN N Out is the the prices are pretty reasonable.  The restaurant can get pretty packed.  Sometimes they are slow to clean the tables.  So you end up guarding the table you want to sit at waiting for someone to come clean it.  If you have guest from out of town that aren't from California you have to take them to In-N-Out burger.

My regular order is a 4x4 animal style, protein style, easy sauce burger with fries well-done and a large lemonade. 4x4 (aka 4 by 4) takes its base burger format from the double double, e.g. meat, cheese, meat, cheese; the result of ordering a burger ends up being meat, cheese, meat, cheese, meat, cheese, meat, cheese. Animal style burgers are made fresh daily with mustard grilled into the meat. Protein style means no bun, wrap the burger in one big leaf of lettuce. Ordering this back in the 70s and earlier was a big secret. Now, not so much. But the quality is always good and they don't miss a beat taste or presentation. Well done fries means the fries are made crispier, almost potato chip crunchy on the outside. Great change up on the regular order of fries.

Everyone is courteous. The food comes out quickly and well presented. The only real drawback is that there are better burgers in town filled with burger competition.

What's my bottom line? Give them your money and eat their food. The price is right for what they have and it is a drive-thru, fast food joint giving you quality for your buck. My actual rating is a solid 4.1 stars...",0,azBg2Tl2ncITAXKdX07tGQ

I enjoyed sinking my teeth into that nice, juicy, fresh tasty burger that came with a basket of copious amounts of fries! I almost want to say that the burgers were better at Five Guys, but the prices at Five Guys are just completely rediculous.

Only complaint is that those booths are rediculously tiny! They were NOT made for 4 people to use! None of the three of us are large people. I am the ""largest"" at 5'7 and 170 and I felt like we had to get a little too cozy to fit in there. Next time Ill get it to go! ;)

- Grilled cheese?... got it!
- You want an animal style milkshake?... small or medium?

Beyond the one million food algorithms you can create here, the prices are still considerably lower than any other fast food place. I mean my order is almost always under six dollars and is sufficient enough to feed the beast. A double double, fries, and water. Yeah. I don't drink soda.

We arrived in Vegas just 2-3 days after the new In-n-Out opened in the LINQ Promenade, so we didn't have to drive out to bumblefuck in order to get it. The line at about 9:30pm was relatively short and we got our burger relatively quickly. We took them back to our rooms since half of us wanted In-n-Out and the other half wanted Shake Shack (In-n-Out's vegetarian option is...to be it frankly, sad). 

The fries, first of all, were just disappointing. They're regular fries - but overly salted fries. I dare to say that even McDonald's fries are better! The burger itself wasn't anything spectacular. I got mine Animal Style and it kind of just tasted like a ""real"" Big Mac. I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I didn't hate it either. My friend from San Francisco has already disowned me.

They offer many different types of burgers from cheeseburger, hamburger, Double Double, and so much more. Their well known French Fries are so fresh that you can see them making it from scratch of cutting the potatoes into slices and frying them. In-N-Out also have the ""Secret Menu"" where you can order tons of stuff. You can find the ""Secret Menu"" in their website. The ""Animal Style Fries"" from the secret menu is the one I usually order and trust me, IT'S THE BEST! It has fried onion and their ""spread"" sauce. If you want to be fit, they have the ""Protein Style"" burger where instead of buns, they replace it with lettuce.

If you want more spice in your burger, they offer the ""Yellow Chili Pepper"" as one of the condiments. The chili taste very good with the burger and would probably make you sweat a little. Add the ""spread"" sauce to your burger and experience the taste of it. It may taste something that is very familiar.

If you want some dessert, you should try their shakes! Their shakes are very delicious and will make your stomach satisfied and happy.

Their fast food restaurants are always busy in the drive thru and inside. The facility inside In-N-Out is alright. They always have someone to clean up the restroom and the dining room.

On their secret menu, you can get your burgers or fries Animal Style... its basically something like a thousand island sauce.

Let me start by saying that people come from around the world to Las Vegas and THIS is most divination a ""destination location"" 

I have been to so many In N Outs and never seen one as dirty as this one. From the bathrooms to the tables and floors, down right dirty. In fact, if I didn't know how amazing the meal was going to be I would have looked at this as another McDonald's. Which is an insult.

In N Out is supposed to be a family owned and operated company that cares about the quality of their food and the foundation of which is was born. And yes, you are just fast food. But you're more than that. Which is why my expectations are so high. If the owner walked through this location at this time someone was for sure getting fired.

Go for the double double or 3x3 and get the usual toppings but add a whole grilled onion - game-changer.  The ingredients are always fresh and delicious.

The one downside with this location is it's proximity to the Strip.  While this may make it more convenient for you to get here, it also makes it convenient for the masses to converge onto this one location during the lunch hours.  The lines can often wrap into the dining area, and seating is doggone difficult to find (pardon my language).  The service is usually pretty quick with the army of burger flippers, fry guys, and runners that they have, but it can be pretty hectic.

No matter where I go, either here or any location in CA or AZ or here in town, this place knocks it out of the park. 

Ordered a double double with no lettuce, tomato, or onion, but added grilled onions for no cost (basically the way to get it animal style, without saying animal style) :) Also got the fries animal style, yes I know, let's have a few calories today for lunch ehh?
Walked right up to the counter at about 1:45 yesterday, (5/20) and the kid was quick at the register, got everything right, and the price I think was in the $8.50 range. 

This location isn't the closest to me in town, but when I'm cruising down the 215 or in the st. rose and eastern intersection area sometimes I'll hop over to this location and knock out a double double (this location as most of you will know is just seconds off the 215 and Eastern exit, on the east side of the street) 

I got an unusual amount of fries this time, not real sure why but they were awesome, it took me a long damn time to polish these off, but man they always have the perfect crispiness and you know they're fresh.

The consistency of the burgers are always spot on, they've really got this assembly line thing down!!! Almost always I order my burger with grilled onions, and I always get animal style on the fries. The fries are cut fresh from huge potatoes, you can watch them smash and string the potatoes right before they throw them in the fryer and serve them to you. The burger always has a little crispiness to the bun and the cheese drips out of the burger as you eat it. MY KIND OF BURGER!!!! Luckily I've always had a fast metabolism and can eat about whatever I want and stay pretty lean and it's a good thing! There's plenty of calories in this meal!

The place was packed, which is why I am not a huge fan of this location. I'm going to guess that it's hard to find cheap eats on the Strip, so that's why the situation. There was just a huge line to order, a while to wait, a number system that didn't seem to be in any order so you really had to pay attention, and no where to sit. I will give them credit, that they did a pretty good job keeping things moving, all things considered. I just personally don't like being in big crowds and then eating standing up because that's my only option.

The burger was nice and juicy and lettuce and tomato provided the perfect contrast. The fries were great, described by my boyfriend as ""too salty"" but I say there's no such thing.

Why aren't they just throwing a bunch of pattys on the fryer and setting up at least a one patty burger during that time?

   I don't understand why I can go to a Chinese restaurant, order three different dishes, out of a menu of about 50 or so different items, and get all of that faster than it would to get a burger in a place that sells one thing in three variations.

Just don't go there during the lunch rush. Especially if you're on lunch because you won't make it back in time. Even if you worked at that In N Out, you won't make it back in time from lunch.

 The staff was very friendly and helpful on decisions for my co workers who ordered burgers with unnecessary amounts of Patty's. I however opted for the fries.

We just returned to Texas after a two week trip to Vegas.  This particular In-N-Out Burger has a sign right next to I15 that reaches to the sky which calls many autos off the freeway.  It also got to us as we headed to our hotel!

First, it was so crowded that we should have taken our clue from that.  The line to order went all through the entire restaurant and there was not a clean table in the place.  My husband got in line and I finally found a table someone was abandoning and claimed it for us.  In a corner just for two.

When my husband finally arrived I was thrilled to see the burgers, fries, and drinks, as In-N-Out is my favorite burger joint in Vegas and CA.  Well, one bite and I had wished we were at Jack-in-the-Box!  Very small piece of meat, dried out, and just awful!  Fries?  I don't even know how to describe them.  Needless to say, this ruined our going to another In-N-Out the entire trip.  Usually we make 2-3 runs to one when we are in Vegas, as TX's has none.  I guess they don't have to be so up-to-par as the others since most of their business comes from the freeway and the stip.

AND...... whenever we go to Vegas, our first stop off the plane is to....you guessed it. They are quite packed in Vegas so we always have a Plan B and Plan C location to fall back on. Imagine my amazement when I found out that this burger haven now has a location right off the Vegas Strip. It is officially listed as at The Linq, but is right around the corner from The Flamingo Hotel in the alleyway leading to the Giant Ferris Wheel. Now we were able to walk there after checking into our hotel. As with other locations, the crowd was plentiful but the young staff was quite efficient in filling the orders and getting the food in your hands in a reasonable time. My wife in the meantime secured a nice table outside. So, that's where the good review ends with the pleasant and efficient staff. They get the one star that I have awarded. As for the food......my love of all In-N-Outs has come crashing down to earth. I ordered my usual Double-Double and Fries. The burger which is usually juicy, was cooked beyond recognition. It was horribly overdone and I actually threw it out after eating half of it. My wife's was the same. Now, they can't also screw up the freshly made Fries, can they? Yes they can and they did! These Fries were so overdone, charred and dried out that they were like those dry straws you buy in a bag or can. How can they mess up what every other location has brilliantly delivered?

If you mention In N Out to a casual, you get the same reaction as a middle aged housewife listening to Dave Matthews Band - endless fawning and drooling. The service is decent, but the order takers have no clue as to what's going on. The problem itself lies to the use of a ""secret menu."" I don't refer to the tiny menu the restaurant has, but rather a set of secret code words to order your food to make it sound like you're ""cool"" and ""one of them."" And they can't even get THAT right, as my ""mustard fried"" burger came out tasting the same like one of their normal burgers!

Let's talk about the burger itself. They are two ounce patties, and although the menu tops out at double-double, you can have four of these patties on your sandwich. But no bacon. Almost every other fast food restaurant allows bacon for an extra charge. But not at In N Out. They're special.

The standard burger (Yes, I'm calling it a burger here, deal with it fanboys) comes pre-dressed with lettuce, tomato, onion and this crap called ""Spread."" Spread? What the #$!%@ is spread? Well it's a combination of ketchup, mayo and relish. I like these, but how hard is it to just mix it separately? Why make matters more complicated? You can customize your burger, but why not just do what Five Guys does? That being order the burger and then they ask what you want, and not assuming a set selection of toppings. Simplify.

The fries suck. Not sorry. They are cheap, but what you pay for is what you get. You get this tiny school lunch size carton with the tiniest, driest fries this side of McDonalds. They're not fries. They're fry-ettes. You can supposedly put this ""animal style"" sauce on the fries for no extra charge, but why should I have to guzzie up my food with something that looks like emesis?

They also serve Coca-Cola products, but they can't even get THAT right! Do you want Sprite? Tough break, you get 7-Up, instead. These people had 7-Up in their lineup for years and don't feel the need to switch, I guess.

Don't let the huge line fool you, folks. In N Out is overrated, overhyped and simply not worth it for the miniscule, medicore meal you get.

Oh, you're looking for a compliment? It's inexpensive. There.

Tried UC Irvine INOB last month but apparently did it wrong. Now in the know, I ordered animal style double and animal style fries.

A BK Whopper is no fancy fast food burger, but to me it's more Miller High Life. It's the champagne of burgers. Has actual meat and grill/charcoal taste and a good balance of toppings. Fries are way better too! INOB fries are disastrously bad! Like deep fried cardboard!

We got there at Lunch Rush... and this location is right next to UNLV.

Be forewarned.  

The place was packed in like sardines, with people oozing everywhere.

So.  We ordered.  Animal Burgers.  Animal Fries.  

Waited about 15-20 minutes for our food.  (Seriously??)

I actually watched our burgers ""sit"" on the counter (there are no heat lamps here, people) while our fried were prepared.  For a good 3-4 minutes they sat there.  

Suffice it to say this place could use some serious expo-of-food-organization help.

Anyway.  The food, for what is is ($7.50) was fine fast food fare, as it was the first time we tried In-n-Out.  The fries this time were hot, though, and tasted better under their onslaught of melted processed cheese slice, cooked onions, and thousand islan... Uh, I mean ""Spread.""

Other than that?  It's a Fast Food Place.  They may rave about their ""Fresh Cut"" fries and their ""Never Frozen Beef""... but I still wouldn't eat one of their patties on its' own, without the helping hand of a LOT of cheese, bun, and ""spread.""

I will say this; it's the best chain fast food burger you can get in America. Now, you must remember, it is still just a burger.

Imagine the $150 burger at Daniel; will the taste stand up to the anticipation?  At some point in the continuum, no experience can possibly meet the high expectations. I was past that point, but that doesn't mean that I can't recognize this fantasticness.

What really got me was the grease.  

The grease dripping from the burger wasn't the solid grease you get from a burger at every other fast-food chain, it was probably 75% water/25% grease.  Since the patties were created with fresh, never frozen beef, you get this product.  That wasn't the only mark of quality I hung on to.

The tomatoes were more crisp than the lettuce most places, and the lettuce crunched like a potato chip.  As the pickles protruded from the sides of the sandwich, I began to ponder what I would have received if I'd ordered extra pickles.  The cheese was deli style; thick, substantive. 

I ordered the fries well-done; my mistake.  They came out like potato sticks.  Not terrible, but just stick to the regular fries.

The Neapolitan Shake - I received it before my meal was ready and drank it in seconds.  Without question, the shake was the highlight of the meal.  More dense than the McDonald's and BK shakes, thinner than a Frosty; vanilla, chocolate and strawberry never combined to create such a simple taste sensation.

All in all, a wonderful place.  For the money, it is tough to beat.  But, does it beat Ben's Chili Bowl?  A Fenway Sausage?  No.

I really do wish they mad more variety cause you are SOL if your friends decide on In-N-Out and you want something other than burger.

Also their service rocks! I know its weird to talk about service at a fast food restaurant but the employees here rock! They never get the order wrong, they are super nice, quick, and on top of getting you whatever you need. It really does make a difference.

If you haven't already, check out their secret menu which I am sure you can find on the internet. One of the worst kept secrets in the fast food world. Also keep an eye out for the random bible verses they have on all their stuff.",3,ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw

Like all the other locations, this one serves up the same fresh food and great service. Located right of the I-15, this location is probably the closest for anyone staying on the Strip. 

There isn't much variety here so my order usually looks the same: double-double animals styles with a lemonade. Being so close to the Strip also means this place is always packed. After midnight you will see a flurry of taxi's clogging up the drive-thru and a line up to the door for dine-in.

Just a young pup who was lucky enough to have the coolest cab driver in the city, he took me on a out-of-towner tour of this great town (sounds like the start of a bad movie but really wasn't; I'm still around to tell it) which led to the final stop at my request: In-N-Out.

Not used to waiting for fast food since I've never been to this establishment, the cab driver even held the meter for me. 

Sorry to say it was not a wild and crazy Hangover-style time in Las Vegas, but this was a highlight (that sounds sad to some of you all, I know).

I had the number 2 cheeseburger meal, animal style, with fries and a drink. The meal was served logically and there was a lot of food. $6.11 for all of that? Okay.

My only complaint is that my visit was during a Saturday evening dinner rush and there was only one cashier working. It took forever to place my order!

When I was a student, the proximity to campus was fantastic.  And I don't know if it still exists, but there used to be sneaky-ninja parking behind the restaurant where I parked my car regularly and was never towed.  I am sure I went at least an entire semester without paying for on-campus parking because of this sneaky-ninja space.  

Also when I was a student, the affordability of this place and the fillingness (I'm not sure if that's a word but you get my meaning) of the meal was super appreciated.  

I can honestly say that I do not have any recollection of having bad service here, whether drive-through or dine-in, and again, that's going on many (many) years of coming here. 

The food always tastes fresh.  While the actual menu items are limited, the 'styles' are varied.  Check out the not-so-secret menu (per your favorite internet search engine) and you'll know what I mean.

For those of you coming in from anywhere but CA, AZ and NV (maybe they are in Utah and Oregon now...I don't know)...you are in for a real treat. The menu is simple and ordering is as easy as 1, 2, 3 (i'm not just saying that #1 combo is a double double, fries and a drink, #2 is a cheeseburger, fries and a drink and #3 is a hamburger, fries and a drink).

My favorite meal (and probably one I would pick before I go and meet the Lord someday many moons from now) is a #1 animal style, well done fries (takes a bit longer but well worth the wait), rootbeer and if i'm feeling saucy (which is pretty common) I go for the vanilla milkshake.

I rolled into Vegas on a Saturday afternoon, just to visit my favorite cheesy reality TV locations (Pawn Stars and American Restoration, if you must know).  I planned to stay on the Strip for one night, and spend the wages of sin alone and unsupervised in a neon blur of whiskey and poker chips.

But souvenir shopping accomplished, I realized I was not in the mood to stay in Sin City as a solo, squandering my earnings and tarnishing my spirit in a land of debauchery.  Sin is more fun with company.

Instead I headed towards Death Valley, a better match for my mood.

And there, on the outskirts of town, where the concrerte meets desert, it was.  In-N-Out.  And I was hungry.

I had heard the legends.  Tales of mysterious lingo and off-menu items known only to the initated, the In-N-Out Illuminati.

I spoke into the speaker words I had been taught to remember, but did not fully understand: ""Double double. Animal Style. Chocolate Shake.""

Expect the usual great tasting food and fantastic customer service. Nothing has changed about those qualities that In-N-Out is known for, but do expect the following:

- There are long lines that can stretch out to the door, but they move fairly quickly.

- Be prepared to wait more than 10 minutes for your food to be ready. This was not due to service, but due to the large volume of orders.

- Limited seating. Actually, there's plenty of seating, but it might be tough finding a spot; bring extra people to seat stalk and reserve spaces.

- Sticky floors and messy tables. Considering how this place receives a lot of traffic, I can imagine that it'd be difficult to keep it spic-and-span. However, the employees do their best to make sure the restaurant is cleanly. 

My suggestion would be to visit another In-N-Out location. But if you're dying to have an In-N-Out Burger fix and don't mind the wait, then by all means give this location a go.",6,epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg

I cannot be in the vicinity of an INO and not get a Double-Double Animal Style... I need that sauce coursing through my veins. So my recent trip to Vegas, and a new INO right near the strip (but not within walking distance...no sidewalks), we had to go.

We pulled in right around lunchtime, and the line of cars was spilling out into the street - lucky there is a very large parking lot. We parked and walked in to an equally large line of people - but with 3 registers open, it moved quickly. We opted to take the food to go and eat at one of the picnic tables outside. Our numbers were 30 away when we placed our orders, but getting the food took very little time - so this is a very efficient location.

The food came out perfectly. Hot, flavorful, delicious! I also got an order of animal-style fries (highly recommend, but you need a fork to eat them).

The food is incredible, yet simple. The staff is super friendly. And for how crowded it usually is, In-N-Out delivers their product consistently, and at lightning speed. 

A few tips for the newbies: 

~ In-N-Out has a secret menu. Be sure to ask for things like grilled onions, chopped peppers, protein style (no bun, wrapped in lettuce), the 4x4 (4 patties and 4 pieces of cheese), animal fries (fries with cheese, sauce, and grilled onions), or even a grilled cheese!

~ In-N-Out's fries usually run on the chewy side. Ask for them well done if you want them nice and crispy; they make them fresh to order!

I was so glad to find out there was a In-N-Out burger in Vegas and it was somehow ""close"" to our hotel according to Google Maps.

It took us forever to get there.. Almost an hour because we took the wrong side of the sidewalk. It was really sad to see the sign of In-N-Out but we couldn't pass through the highway to eat there...

Please take the sidewalk along Excalibur hotel (W Tropicana Ave) and walk straight until you arrive on Dean Dr Martin, then you will see and smell In-N-Out! You can also take the taxi to get there (easier and faster)!

Even before we got there, we could smell their burgers/fries and it smelled so good! There were a lot of people and the parking slot was all filled with cars. It was a little bit hard to find seats for 6 people but we didn't want takeout since it is always better to eat it there, right? 

I ordered the animal-style hamburger (with hand-leafed lettuce, tomato, a mustard cooked beef patty; add pickle, extra spread with grilled onions) and an animal-style fries (melted Cheese, Secret Spread that looks like Thousand Island dressing and Grilled Onions). I should have picked the cheeseburger instead of hamburger just to have more textures. I would like to try their Protein style (burger wrapped with lettuce instead of buns) since it sounds ""healthier"". 

Although some people find the animal-style a bit too greasy and heavy, I find it perfect since it made the fries even more flavorful! My parents' friends loved In-N-Out so much that they said they wouldn't mind eating this everyday while they are still in Vegas (they loved it more than Shake Shack)!",4,WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw

Nope.  Double doubles are all that and then some.  The fries are heaven.  I probably shouldn't have eaten here because now I won't be satisfied with the burgers I get here in Texas.

Tip: you CAN walk here from the strip.  Just walk down the sidewalk on the excalibur side of the street across the freeway bridge entrance area and under another little bridge and you're there.

Seems more like ""creeper fishy"" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru. 

Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a ""Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions"" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered ""Animal Style Fries"" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a ""Flying Dutchman"" for them and they will thank you :)

Well, they repeated the order back to us true I&OB style.

We pulled away (napkins covering the food so couldn't see it just yet) and eagerly pulled into the parking lot across the street to get our grub on.

The fries were black, and I mean blaaaaack. They were mostly nubs instead of regular long fries. 

I have been eating I&OB for decades and know they are the most consistent food chain out there. I had only one time ever had an issue at a location where the fries were black and I called their 800 # to complain and I have to say I never ever thought a fast food company would go so above and beyond to satisfy a customer. I was very very impressed.

Sure, I could call and complain about this visit but I'm not looking for freebies and I know for a fact I will be eating I&OB for many more decades to come as it is just too darn delicious. I instead just talked directly to the manger so he was aware as I know he knows that preparing the food a I&OB correctly is the standard they want to uphold.  He was very polite and apologetic.

And the only thing you could find in the frat house refrigerator was a bag of frozen french fries that had been in there since your freshman year. But being desperate, you threw them in the oven at 500 degrees ('cause you just couldn't imagine waiting 15 minutes to eat). And then you burned yourself on the pan when you pulled them out, but you were too stoned to feel the pain (although you were quite certain you were going to feel it in the morning). Do you remember how, after just a few bites of what might just be the nastiest thing you ever ate, you threw them in the garbage and thought to yourself, ""What's the use? What's the point to all of this? Why do I even bother? Why do I even go on"" And when you woke up late the next afternoon, you went straight down to the registrar's office and changed your major to philosophy. Then you started getting drunk and smoking pot every night with that long-haired old guy who hangs out at the bar, the guy who never showers and always hits on the freshmen girls who sneak in on the weekends; only to find yourself dropping out of college a few months later because you just couldn't disseminate the intellectual struggle between being and nothingness, and your professors were just too stupid to understand you. And now, 20 years later, you're living back home in your parents house, unable to keep a job and drinking away your paycheck every night in that same college bar. And when you look at yourself in the broken bathroom mirror you suddenly realize that you have become that old, smelly drunk who still hits on college girls. And you look back at your life and think to yourself -

""If only I'da skipped those fries, everything in my life would be different now.""

Trust me, those fries were gourmet compared to In-N-Out Burger's. They tasted like powdery, freezer burned match-sticks that had been reheated under a heat lamp - it was difficult to tell if they were made from potatoes or from some Star Trek food simulator machine.

My burger was equally disgusting. It is fair to say the only part of the burger that did not suck was the lettuce. The bun was stale and dry, the browned skin of the bun's top peeled off like 60 year old wallpaper from an old pickle factory, leaving what looked and tasted like a frozen bun that was thawed on high in the microwave..

I have nothing to complain about with the vanilla shake - at last, nothing to complain about.

In all told, my last visit to In-N-Out Burger was as disappointing as anything you could imagine. My guess is, there IS a limit to how much you can cut-back on quality just to save a dime. It's a shame for such an iconic brand.",10,pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ

The food was great as expected but what this review is for, is for management.
My family and flew to Vegas for my 21st birthday and were excited to see an In N Out, as we dont have one in Seattle. We sat outside and there are pigeons which is totally fine we love animals but what really disgusted me was the teenagers sitting adjacent to us throwing their used sauce packets at the birds, when we spoke up about it to them IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS they ignored us but figured they got the message. After about 10 minutes the parents left the kids and drove off. 5 minutes pass and they do the same thing as last time, this time hitting the bird. We spoke up AGAIN and they started arguing with us about it. So my mom got management to come out and do whatever they had to do, if that meant kicking them out or telling them to stop. Well that didnt go so well. They brought out what looked like their best friend as when he came out they greeted him by first name and gave him pats on the back as he told them quietly to ""chill out"" as soon as he left the kids laughed at us. Right after that they threw ANOTHER sauce packet and after that we didnt say anything, we just went inside and asked for the General Manager or a phone number we can talk to and were told that ""these are just how Las Vegas kids are"" we got outside and another older lady speaking to them telling them about respect for elders and soon after they left.

I've had it in several states in the last 14 years. Its still one of my favorite spots. 

People seem to get overly excited about the secret menu, and that's nice and all, but it's nothing new, far from secret, and definitely not a game changer...funny how people love to be in the know of anything that's supposedly ""secret""..it's not illuminati folks!...lol ..(extra crispy fries, animal style, protein style, etc, etc) yes its good stuff but lets face it, the bragging rights component is far more important (to most people) than anything you'll consume, cause again, it's not overwhelmingly great...it's good though. I just laugh when I witness first hand the smugness and self satisfaction people experience as they share this ""life altering news"" as if they know some secret MI6 agent behind the counter that can ""hook them up, cause they are special""... like disney dust to a 5 year old..all because they know the secret ""language"" lol..(out of towners that might have In N Out twice a year become cool kids all of a sudden)......Jheer ahsum dewd!

Ok so now that we have that out of the way, I would have given the review 5 stars, since In N Out is one of my top 3 burgers (along with Dicks in Seattle and 5 Guys), however the service at this specific location is so poor I had to average the score.

I've been to this location since they first opened years ago, and this place has really suffered a major decline..

Service here, especially at night, really sucks. They take waaaaaaaaaaay longer than  usual to fulfill your order, the place is never clean, homeless constantly pan handle at this location (they stand right next to the entrance and pan handle) and mgmt does nothing about it. The funny thing is, by comparison, they aren't THAT busy!  Is it because they are under staffed?  Whatever it is, it's VERY noticeable if you've ever eaten at In n Out before. 

The pedestrian drive thru order taker is rarely there, and when they are, they can't get  to the entire line since the signal range on their device only goes up to 5 ft from the normal drive through speaker box (so what the F is the point?!?!?) Several times I'll provide my order to this drive thru walker, only to have them say, ""I'm sorry sir but something is wrong with our mobile system, just pull forward and provide them your order""..an absolute waste of time further delaying the experience.....Other things that have happened here on several occasions: incorrect change given, incorrect order (who the hell messes up a plain cheeseburger?), overcharged, cold and stale fries, rude service, always forgetting items, salt, ketchup, napkins (drive thru), and massive delays...to name a few.

If I were to sum up THIS SPECIFIC In N Out location, it would be to compare it to that of a McDonald's....IN A WALMART!  And If you don't know what I'm talking about, go to any Walmart in Las Vegas, and dine in at the built in McDonalds, they all have them. It's what it sounds like, and what you would expect. Shitty on many levels. Sub Par even for Fast Food Standards...

Bottom Line: Save yourself some trouble and skip this location, head to Five Guys which is just up the road less than 2 mins north on LVB, or if you are set on In N Out, head to the Ft Apache or Tropicana location.",4,qmDuC6dwWvtWHFt-xNovag

But this is the first time I'm reviewing an In-N-Out, because the service here really impressed me.

I was sitting eating my order, and I noticed an elderly man and his son had sat down at the table next to us. They had finished ordering and gathering their drinks, and the son had left to go to the restroom. There was a worker, her name was Kim, who had noticed that their order was finished and was called a few times. The son wasn't there and I dont believe the elderly man had heard through the general noise. I looked up and I saw she had looked for the elderly man and went out of her way to give him his food. 

I thought this was just, genuinely really really great, especially with the general madness of how In-N-Out usually is. And ESPECIALLY considering how it was extra packed due to it being Black Friday. I don't really find or see that kind of service around, and I know it's small, but I thought it was thoughtful and great and was worth mentioning on a holiday that's become notorious for being crazy in the US (all those videos of crazy Black Friday shoppers you know). 

And as always, the food was delicious.

I was surprised at how cheap it was! These burgers are seriously a great deal. It comes with onions, lettuce, cheese, tomato, the usual - and they have their special thousand island-tasting sauce. The fries are pretty good too, especially when dipped wit the burger sauce. It's not the best burger out there, (there are many others I would recommend in my own city), but I still like it. 

Not sure how I feel about the service, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The manager came to our table to randomly talk to us, and he came back about another 2-3 times to talk and ask questions while we were eating, and gave us some hats. I thought he was just bored or really liked us because he we were from out of town, I don't know - but when we finished our food he asked us if we had a working phone, and to call a certain number so that we could put in a good word for him. I forget his name now, but he was very demanding about it. Now we know why he talked to us for so long... and he said we HAD to call that number while we were still in the restaurant. When we said we would do it later he still insisted that we do it right then and there which made us feel a little uncomfortable... tsk tsk.

Once you get prepared and realize this is not a fast food place, you then have to judge the food.   The burgers are greasy and tasty but definitely do not compare to a grilled giant patty at numerous other restaurants here in town.  The ingredients are fresh but somehow always manage to fall out from the burger no matter how fancy In-&-Out wraps them.  

The fries are tiny and average.  They are so small, I often find myself having to pinch a number of them just to get a substantial bite.  Also the tiny size of them tend to lead to getting ketchup on the fingertips when dipping.  

Another thing that has always bugged me about this place is the incredible crassness and smugness that many patrons exhibit by knowing about the ""secret menu.""  Newsflash people...There is nothing secret about any menu since the advent of the internet.

pros:

We decided it wasn't a good idea and we'd make our venture there another day since we were already too hungry at the time. Well the next day, we took a cab from our hotel to In-N-Out which was basically less than a 5-minute ride.

Next time I'll order 3x3 and the fries with cheese (I know animal style is probably best but I'm not a fan of all the stuff they put in it unfortunately).

I had eaten a burger here in NorCal a few years ago and was unimpressed, but my palate wasn't as refined so I figured I'd give it another shot.

My dad, brother and I went at lunch time on a Friday. The line was long but orders were taken quickly and food was coming out constantly. It was truly impressive!

Now as for what I ordered: a #1 Double Double with everything (including onion), fries and a Coke. I picked up some of the ""Chiles"" too.

So the Chiles are just baby pepperoncini I guess, but they were tasty. The fries were weak. I know they're fresh but they're dry and crunchy, like canned Potato Sticks you can get in the store. The burger was tasty, and while I hate Big Mac sauce and thousand island dressing, I actually did like the In-N-Out sauce. I'd put the burger a notch above Wendy's but that's it. My brother got a vanilla shake and it tasted like someone blended up McDonald's ice cream cones, including the actual cake cone. Meh. It's also taken a few hours to dissolve the salt left in my throat from the food.

Five Guys destroys In-N-Out in every regard. The selection of toppings at Five Guys is astounding and their boardwalk style fries have NO EQUAL.

I always go for a cheeseburger (protein style). The lettuce is always fresh and crunchy which I love but the way it's put together (condiments etc) is sometimes better than other times.

I sit at the impeccably clean table.  I unwrap.  Oh, it looks good.  I pick up my burger, take that bite, and.....

I was completely UNDERWHELMED.  What the hell is THIS?

Don't get me wrong.  The burger was good.  It tasted just fine.  But....where is the manna from heaven I was expecting?

There are other types of burger styles too such as a double or veggie style. Overall awesome place to stop by and grab burger and fries.

Def the best bang for your buck in Vegas. After an all day and night drinking orgy, go treat yourself correct at In-N-Out!!",0,Do3H6xkpNZf242cBpI7QcA

The burger was very juicy, and the sauce on the burger didn't overwhelm the flavor.  The fries were good.

Almost every review mentions how busy this location is and they are all correct.  We waited about 20 minutes to place and receive our order.  The parking lot was almost full near the restaurant although there's another lot north of the main one.  The interior was jammed with people.  A friend waited in line to place our order while I walked around trying to score a table.  It was almost like playing musical chairs and I finally sat at one two seater table before someone else.

SInce I don't generally buy burgers out (I like them cooked rare and most places don't do this) I have less experience with burger joints. This would have been a 4 star review but for the wait and the quickness with which we had to eat or burger to get to our show on time.",1,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

One thing is for certain, a trip out west is not complete without a visit to In-N-Out Burger.  On my trip earlier this month, I was fortunate to have In-N-Out Burger twice, once in Los Angeles (at a wedding!) and once at this location just off the famed Las Vegas strip.

Going to In-N-Out is always an experience.  The restaurant sign is reminiscent of all the bright neon lights of the strip.  You pull into the parking lot and it's packed with cars, plus at least 5 taxi cabs too.  When you walk into the restaurant, there is a line to take your order, but it moves at a decent pace.  Above the counter is the menu.  It's pretty simple and minimalist.  The hubby and I ordered two Cheeseburgers at $2.45 each and an order of Fresh French Fries at $1.65.  Including tax our order came to $7.08.  Wow!  That's the cheapest, most affordable meal we had in our 4 days in Las Vegas.  My husband called me a cheap date!  But hey, when you have an In-N-Out craving, nothing else will suffice.

There is definitely an interesting crowd inside the restaurant, so we opted to take our food to go and brought it back to our hotel room to have with a bottle of red wine, classy I know.

I really wish In-N-Out Burger would expand to the East Coast, but I'm also pretty sure this will never happen as all of their food is fresh and never frozen, so it cannot travel too far from their processing centers.

I highly recommend stopping here on your next trip to Vegas!",9,NiHQDtfUigKLYjtm3FYKSw

I ordered the double-double, which is their top of the line burger (why wouldn't I try their best as a first timer?) and I wasn't disappointed.  

The wait was a bit longer than your average fast food restaurant but that's because they make each burger fresh.  It arrived neatly wrapped and ready to eat with a side of freshly cut fries.  The bun wasn't soggy at all and every bite was as fresh as the last.  Could've been one of the best burgers I'd ever had.

I also ordered a vanilla milkshake which was SUPER thick and tasty.  I love milkshakes but hate how they can melt before you're done.  Not this one.  They're practically serving you soft-serve in a cup and straw.  

The customer service was unusually excellent for a fast food place.  Sure, they are trying to resemble a 50's burger joint.  Hence, the limited menu (i.e. no swiss mushroom angus burger with jalapenos etc, no kids meals and toys, etc) and something that most fast food places have neglected.....something called customer service.  Both of the gentlemen working the floor were very kind and came over to our table multiple times to see how things were.  Very unusual for a fast food place but very welcomed!

Unfortunately there is some kind of virus in the air here (must be the wind patterns) that makes people shit bricks over In-N-Out. I must have contracted it because now I can't help but like it. :(

The hamburgers are decent fast-food fare as long as you add grilled onions and leave off the GOD-AWFUL spread. With the spread they taste exactly the same as McDonalds. The shakes are tasty - it's not hard to make a good shake. The fries are pretty bland but can be saved if you order them well-done.

There are so many better chain hamburgers to be had. Five Guys is way better, and Smashburger is the best. But when you're on the long, lonely road to L.A. (god forbid), the Barstow In-N-Out is pretty much the best thing along the route. And if you're a Californian tourist coming in to town, you probably can't help but be drawn to the giant sign like a neon beacon.

In-N-Out is a slightly-above-average fast food chain that, like Chick-fil-A, is good but not nearly deserving of all the hype it gets. When I want a fast food hamburger, I'll stick with Smashburger.",2,ITNVSsPgUIWOwgKMSqwZ2w

In and Out fries are not that great, but the burgers make it totally worth it(and you better like burgers because you can't get anything else there aside from pop and or a fantastic shake!)...unlike McD's and the rest of the places, they are literally using fresh beef to make the burger, the buns are fresh and buttered and they come with FRESH sliced tomato, onion and lettuce and a special sauce that is to die for...they use real cheese for the cheese fries too!

This place is like an institution on the west coast!!  They even have one within walking distance to my college alma mater UNLV!  Yes, yes...many good memories...some very memorable, some a lil' hazy thanks to my introduction then to cheap liquor...and even cheaper college women.  Nah, just kidding!  I think...

I frequent this In-N-Out the most now a days.  Since my 1st succulent bite at In-N-Out as a prepubescent college geek I've been hooked ever since!  This is my go-to place for a burger when I don't want to think about having a burger.  It is my wingman on a Friday night when I'm doing a Taio Cruz (now sing it, S-O-L-O!), my buddy when no other cheap eats will do.  It is the Robin to my Batman, the Chong to my Cheech, the Ivory to my Ebony.  Wow, I just realized I need to get out more.

Back to the lesson at hand, In-N-Out is really what a hamburger is all about!  Really!  They got the K.I.S.S. thing (Keep It Simple Stupid) down to a science!  No overcomplicated menu, no fancy schmancy, no bad attitudes!  Just meat, cheese, potatoes!  Easy!  I have never had a bad burger at In-N-Out...ever.  If you have, either your order was wrong (which they will gladly fix), or In-N-Out isn't your kind of place!  Everything here is fresh, fresh, fresh, and that is the key to the great burger and fries.  Fresh meat (not frozen like that McDonald's place), fresh cut fries, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions!  The cheese might be processed a bit, but ah, I give them the benefit of the doubt because it's so good!  And they serve COCA COLA!  Yeah, forget you Pepsi!  Sorry to all you Pepsi lovers, but I was born in GA (but yes I am Asian..and yes, I am from Hawaii) so I'm keepin' it real and being loyal to the homies out in the A-T-L.

If you've been to In-N-Out you of course have seen their main menu.  It's only got 3 combos on it!  1-The hamburger, 2-The cheeseburger, and 3-The Double-Double.  How hard can it be to log in an order?  Please!  Even a drunkard can squibble out a number and still be pleasantly fed.  But if you're a fan of In-N-Out or have been coming here for a long time you know all about the 'Secret' menu.  Right?  Come on!  OK, the cat is out of the bag:

http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp

Was that so hard?  Now you can order like an In-N-Out connoisseur just like me!  Here's my usual whenever I hit the joint:

#2 Combo - Cheeseburger 'Animal Style' with extra grilled onions, add raw onion, extra pickle, add mustard, fries well done (trust me, they are good), and a Diet Coke with lemon

See...simple!  Deliciious!  If I'm feelin' really good that day I'll get the fries 'Animal Style' as well!  What's better than fresh fries topped with cheese, grilled onions, and In-N-Out spread?  It may not look appetizing but damn are they tasty!  Need more meat?  Get yours in a Double-Double(2 meat-2 cheese), or a 3x3 (3 meat-3 cheese) or 4x4(4 meat-4 cheese)!  I once knew a guy that liked an 8x8 (8 meat-8 cheese) but that's a bit much for me!  

In-N-Out prides itself on cleanliness, so for the most part the restaurant is very tidy and not funky smelling.  Service here is fast and consistent, while still being very friendly.  Often times the line will be out the door, especially on weekends and late nights!  I constantly see 6-7 cars stacked in the drive thru on a busy day.  You know your burger is doing OK when your neighbors are Panda Express, Raisin Cane's, On the Border, and SmashBurger..and your place is still packed!

Enough of this, the thought is making my mouth water.  I will gladly run extra laps and do extra crunches for this meaty delight!  I feel so bad for you vegetarians and 'Raw' eaters.  How can you not love In-N-Out?  It puts the ""Ooooooooo"" in ""Moooooooo""!!!",0,QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA

Call me crazy - but I DO NOT think in - n - out is the best burger.  It's OK, and thats where it ends.

Burgers and pizza are long time debated food items.  The truth of the matter is, it depends how you like it.  In this case, it depends what you like on your burger.  Since I'm not a fan of slices of cheap raw tomato with snotty tomato goo in the middle, crappy iceburg lettuce, and mystery hot orange sauce, in - n -out is not my burger style.  I'm more of a bacon, sliced avocado, sauteed mushrooms kind of a gal.

The meat and cheese at in-n-out is good.  The patties are flavorful and juicy and the cheesy is melty and generous.  But if you don't like their ALL-American (aka boring) toppings, that's all you get.

The fries suck - plan and simple.  I ordered fries at an in-n-out once; never again.  Now, I just stick to a burger. 

Also, plan on waiting a MINIMUM of 20 minutes just for 1 burger - even at the drive through.",2,DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to eat another meal here on Christmas day because they were closed. Although I was disappointed, I'm happy for the workers who are able to spend Christmas with their families. 

Lastly, I like to clarify a rumor, In-N-Out will never come to Hawaii. The gift shop person tells me that's like building a bridge between Hawaii to California. Their quality control is that strict.",4,rYGi5DJ_54qeoWkkqB21jA

Yes, for a big place, it was packed with people inside and out. I also noticed there were taxis parked. That's a good sign right. People are paying extra money to get good food.

I love their simple menu. You choose from 3 types of burger, fries, drinks, shakes and that's pretty much it. Yes, I love the simple and basic. I order 2 cheeseburger combos. Even though it was a full house, my order was ready within 10 minutes. I love the efficiency too! You can't tell how the burger by looking at the photo. You gotta eat it to get the full experience. Buns were nicely toasted. The beef patty was soft and juicy. It also had organgy sauce for the burger kind of similar to Big Mac sauce. But it tasted perfect. It came with load of fries and I did tell myself that's way too much fries. I never finish my fries EVER. The French fries were out of this world. It was so fresh. You can hardly taste the oil or grease. As it says on the paper tray, potatoes are cut fresh daily. Sadly, fries were gone in no time. I need to order extra next time. I also got a vanilla shake. It was creamy and thick. It's the old-fashioned way.

This chain closes at 1:30 AM on Saturday nights. I specifically pulled up at 1:29 AM when they proceeded to turn the lights off in the drive-through and failed to even acknowledge my presence. They served the car in front of me yet failed to even speak to me. This is not my first rodeo upon closing hour, and the right thing to do would have been to take one last order before that 1:30 mark.

Being the food nerd that I am, had heard of this west coast/southwest regional staple years ago, and I even have a book on its history. 

We came in the mid-afternoon but there was still an impressive line up of at least 15 people, plus others waiting for their orders. What I saw in the store added up with what I had previously heard - a clean store, tiny menu with rock bottom cheap prices (especially compared to fast food in Canada), and a general old school kind of feel. There's no corporate attempts at modernizing, just the same thing that has made In-N-Out what it is today. 

Naturally, I'd heard of their not so secret menu by this point and came armed knowing what I wanted. The line chugged along and orders were coming out of the kitchen at a blistering pace. When it came my time to order, I went with a double double animal style, well done fries and a strawberry shake. I'd like to think I sounded like I knew what I was talking about. 

We patiently waited for a little while and beheld the spectacle of the well-oiled machine of this In-N-Out's kitchen. A few dozen orders later, I had my deep, red tray in hand and hunkered down to eat.

The fries were noticeably darker than my friend's, but not over done, just an eye-pleasing golden brown. They took on an interesting texture being cooked such that they weren't very fluffy inside, just crisp nearly all the way through. It wasn't a fry epiphany for me, but I definitely preferred them over the regular fries.

The burger itself was a sight to behold - the sauteed onions, extra sauce and pickles nearly pouring out of the container. It was a great flavour overall, even if it did somewhat overshadow the beef itself. What bites of unadulterated beef I could get, they were good - beefy, and moist and a little bit of zing from the mustard it was cooked in. The only downside and a very nit-picky one was that the thick slice of beefsteak tomato was distractingly thick and cooled down the burger. All in all, it was a wonderful, hot mess of a burger.

The shake was a fine execution of the classic dessert drink - thick, but not impossible to suck up the straw and the pleasant familiarity of the strawberry flavour.

With my visit later in the day to a Michelin-starred restaurant, I was able to tick off two big items on my foodie ""to do"" list. In-N-Out definitely lived up to the hype for me, and I look forward to when I'm next in a city that has one.",1,zyaQNsI73cLOKttvGnj4bw

This is one of those locations that I will avoid only because it's always busy, out of the way, and the parking lot is crazy.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is efficient.  You can tell who is familiar with this In-N-Out and who isn't.  The rookies will park close to the entrance thinking that they found a great parking spot only to be blocked by the cars in the drive-thru line.  I counted 27 cars ahead of me the last time I was here.  That's crazy!  That's a lot of In-N-Out fans.  Overall, I'm one of them.  You can't go wrong with In-N-Out.  In-N-Out is delicious, cheap, and consistent.",12,y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

1.  Their burgers are always fresh with no preservatives

2.  The menu is basic....Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Double Double, and Fries

3.  A Double Double, Spread Only, and Extra Toast. Nuff Said!

4.  Price is as good as it gets.  A Double Double (2 cheese / 2 patties) is less than $4.00.  The Double Double meal is less than $7.00.  A full meal is about the price of one Cold Brew.  

5.  The Service.  They're so efficient.  Food is ordered and served with the quickness

6.  Their Secret Menu.  My favorite ""off the menu"" item is their Flying Dutchman (2 patties / 2 slices of cheese / No Bun), a 3 x 3 (3 patties / 3 slices of cheese), and Well Done Fries

7.  Low Carb or Keto Friendly.  Cutting your carbs and increasing your fat intake?  For less than $5, Two Flying Dutchman's will do the trick. They're even Vegan friendly. They'll say ""hi"" to them. 

8.  Pet Friendly.  Fido will thank you for the Pup Patty.  

9.  The beef comes from the happy cows of California.  In order to guarantee freshness, In-N-Out is only on the West Coast.  No freezers here.

10. That's What a Hamburger's All About

I will try to avoid this In-N-Out because the lines are always long.  Besides, I have an In-N-Out less than a mile from my house.  The food is still good at this location and I highly recommend their Double Double, with extra spread, and extra toast.  It's less than $5 and bargain.  My recent meals at this In-N-Out have been two Flying Dutchman's (4 patties / 4 slices of cheese).  It's so good that I can eat 10 of these.  This In-N-Out is located next door to a Cracker Barrel.  I will even see peeps leave the Cracker Barrel and head to In-N-Out.

2255,X0Tczp3XH3qTinliAM5TEA,4,2012-10-08,2,16m0s7KK9DH_KTkjtBxrIw,4,"Had what I call ""Burger Weekend"".  Haven't had a fast food burger in a couple of months. So, I made up for it by having a burger Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  This was my Sunday treat.

Let me start by saying that I frequent IN-N-Out in Vegas and in California. I'm eating at one at least once a month.

My usual is a total of 3 Flying Dutchman's.  A Flying Dutchman is two patties with two pieces of cheese. That's it.  I carb load (3 days carbs kept to only 100 grams, followed by 1 day about 400 grams of carbs).  On my ""No Carb"" days, 3 Flying Dutchman's hit the spot. Only about $6 for 90 grams of protein.  Can't beat that!!!

Now for my recent order:
-Double Double:  Spread Only / Extra Toasted
-Cheeseburger:  Same Way
-Fries

Since it's been awhile since I had a burger.  This truly hit the spot.  IN-N-Out burgers are a bit small, so I always have to order 2 burgers.  Patties are small, but always fresh.  

Out of all the IN-N-Outs in Vegas, this one is probably the easiest and quickest.  Anyone been to the one on Craig and 15, they are the longest wait.  This location is in a not so busy shopping center.  Service is good and scary that they even know what I plan on ordering sometimes.  

TIP:  Most know about their secret menu (i.e. Flying Dutchman, Animal Fries, Neopolitan, etc).  You can get the full secret menu online.  I remember back in the day, before the internet, when you only got the secret stuff by word of mouth.",4,y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

2259,EneqsOFGCK4KXofNHsc5aQ,15,2017-01-11,9,-PNl1miG-zE7Lw8mdfefXA,4,"It's official.  In-N-Out Burger is at the LINQ.  This is also our first In-N-Out on the strip. This was news months ago and the predication was that this location is going to be the busiest In-N-Out ever.  I don't know about that.  The Barstow CA and Tropicana NV location is pretty crazy.  

The girlfriend alerted me that this In-N-Out grand opened today and I couldn't resist. I've been to every In-N-Out in Las Vegas/Henderson and wasn't missing a chance at this one, especially since it was the middle of the week. I'm assuming that the lines during the weekends will be cray cray.  There was a line when I arrived, but it's In-N-Out and goes by so quick.  I found one seat open and took it.  I don't know if it's temporary due to grand opening week, but my meal was served to me.  I prefer a Double Double, spread only, extra toast, and well done fries.  But on this visit, I kept it Keto style with two Flying Dutchman's (Two Patties/Two Cheese x 2). Of course I had spread added (awesome sauce!!).  Both Flying Dutchman's were too salty for my liking.  In-N-Out is known for throwing a lot of salt on their patties, but mine was a little too much.  I'll give them a pass since they're new.  

This is not your typical In-N-Out.  For one, there's obviously no drive thru.  And two, the prices are bumped up a bit.  For example, a Double Double is normally $3.60.  Here it's $4.35.  Two Flying Dutchman's usually cost me $4.76.  With a drink, I spent close to $9.00.  A Double Double Meal aka a Number 1 is about $1.50 more.  You get the point. The upcharge is due to location and rent must be exceptionally high.  I get it, I just don't agree with it.  This location is not going to be crazy, it's going to be Karazy.  I'm sure they'll make enough to cover expenses.  In my opinion, locals should get a discount. 

Overall, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  I just don't see myself going out of the way to eat here.  But if I am at the LINQ and in need of a good burger, then you know where to find me. 

TIP #1:  Don't forget about the secret menu.  Animal Style!!
TIP #2:  This location has a Company Store. It's small but good to know.  
TIP#3: Expect tons of tourist here.  It was cool to watch excited customers walking in and out.  I even witnessed a few hi-fives and cheering.  Poor things...we are so privileged out on the west.

I've been to this location a handful of times.  It's conveniently located by one of my offices.  It's so close that I could smell the Animal Fries from across the parking lot.  I think that I would be here a lot more, but it's so damn busy.  The drive thru lines are long.  The lines inside is even longer.  A typical order for me is a Double Double (spread only & extra toast), with fries, and an extra Cheeseburger (also with spread only & extra toast).  Lately, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (4 patties / 4 cheese).  Overall, I can't complain.  The lines may be long, but always worth it.  In-N-Out is a staple meal for me, especially when I'm dieting.

I was told by the staff that this is the busiest In-N-Out in the nation.  The staff really didn't need to tell me this.  It's obvious when you come here. The drive thru and lines inside are both always long.  There's people everywhere and I mean everywhere.  Getting a seat inside the restaurant is rare.  You will see a lot people eating outside, on the curb, in their cars, and even at the In-N-Out Company Store. This location is actually not the last In-N-Out before you head to California, but it is the closest to the start of the Las Vegas Strip and airport.  This is the reason why it's so packed.  Plus, a lot of people love In-N-Out. A lot of out-of-towners can't get enough of it. The staff at this In-N-Out is very prepared for the madness.  They're all well-trained and manage to handle the volume of people with efficiency. 

I recently ate here just because it's been a long time.  Last week was actually the first time I ate here as a Yelper.  I went with the usual, which is two Flying Dutchman's with Spread.  My meal was as good as it was the previous week.  I've had their Double Double, 3x3, Animal Fries, and a Grilled Cheese at this location back in the day.  That was a while back, though. 

This In-N-Out used to be the fun one to go to. I say ""used to be"" only because they no longer create the fun burgers.  The first 100 x 100 that I have seen was at this In-N-Out.  The first Monkey Style Burger that I have seen was also at this In-N-Out.  My understanding is that they will not make both these burgers anymore or they were never allowed to.  It doesn't matter if they don't make these burgers anymore.  In-N-Out has a fan for life.  I'll see you soon, In-N-Out.

That shouldn't be a problem since I eat at In-N-Out at least once a week.  My favorite is their Double Double, Spread Only, and Extra Toast.  It really doesn't get any better than this and it's less than $4.00.  I'll make it a 3x3 if I'm a little hungry.  Obviously, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  Recently, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (2 patties & 2 slices of cheese only) to keep the starches low.  In my opinion, In-N-Out is one of the most consistent fast food joints out there. All that being said, I don't avoid too many In-N-Outs, but I do avoid this one.  The lines inside isn't too long, but it seems to take them a little longer to cook just two patties and cheese.  The drive thru lines always seem to be long and snakes through the parking lot.  Most locations will have a staff member taking your order before you get to the window to speed up the process when it gets busy.  This location doesn't do that, at least they didn't the last 3 times I've been here.  Then there's the cleanliness of the restaurant. I'm spoiled that I live very close to the cleanest and least busy In-N-Out in Las Vegas.  My In-N-Out is always spotless.  This location was a little behind on cleaning up a few tables the last 2 times I've been here.  Overall, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out.  I'm just not a huge fan of this location. Regardless, I'm sure that I will be back to this location at some point. I just never know when I will have those In-N-Out cravings.

As someone not a particular fan of burgers, this is pretty much the only spot I go to and am always happy with a burger. Probably for the fact that their burger patties are thin and don't overpower the rest of the ingredients that make up a burger here. 

This was my first time coming to this location and I came at opening. There were only one two other people ahead of me in line, so I was able to order quickly and only waited maybe 5-7 minutes before my food was ready. The guy at the register taking orders was in good spirits. He was efficient and made sure to repeat each order before telling you the total. He made sure to smile and welcome new customers as they entered. 

Since I came at opening, everything was clean. From all the table to the drink station and the floors. The ketchup was filled as well the drinks and the lemons. Trash was empty and bathrooms clean and stocked. 

I ordered the #2 combo which is a cheeseburger with fries and a drink for just over $5. Can't beat that price for what you get, especially since everything was cooked just right and it was fresh and delicious! I love how the fresh veggies are always so crispy here and they don't skimp on them. Unlike places like McDonald's or Burger King, they make sure to give you a whole piece of lettuce, a large slice of tomatoes and a whole slice of onion as well. If you want something taken out or extra they are always willing to accommodate you.  My guest got the #1 combo which is a double-double and made his fries animal style. Only thing I would've changed was to ask for my fries to be extra crispy, but other than that everything was perfect. 

I will be back again soon.",37,GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A

Located on Maryland Parkway and Tropicana Ava right by UNLV campus, this location is surely an ideal spot for anyone. The parking lot is really small for all the people that come here though. I guess it's a good thing that a lot of the people that come here are college students and they just walk or bike over to this spot. 

I've always just come here at opening for lunch so as to miss most of the lunch rush. By the time I leave though, it's packed. 

Their menu is basic, which I like. I always come in here knowing what I want as I always get the same thing. I always get the Cheeseburger combo, that comes with fries and a drink. Sometimes I get my fries ""Animal style"", which is fries topped with grilled onions and special sauce. I always ask for extra onions on my burger as well. 

Never have to wait long for my food to come out, maybe 3-5 minutes. I love how you can see how your food is made from the counter, so you always know that your food is actually fresh and made right when you order it. I love how the burger is thin as I'm not a big meat person. I want to be able to taste the other ingredients and not only meat. Fries are always nice and crispy when you get them. You can ask for extra crispy as well. 

As for my drink, I always get lemonade. Nothing special about it, but it's still good. I put in extra lemon pieces to make it more tangy.

With as many people that come through here, I am very impressed at how well they keep tables cleaned, trays picked up, napkin holders filled, floors sweep, and overall just keeping everything moving along smoothly.

It opened somewhat recently (less than 1 month ago). People are always comparing In-N-Out (West Coast) with Shake Shack (East Coast) and now that In-N-Out is located on the Strip, people can enjoy both while strolling on the Strip.

This In-N-Out is located in the Linq Promenade area.

When I went in, I was immediately greeted by people behind the cash register. I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I didn't line up. After I quickly looked at the items advertised above the cash register and decided to get a double burger combo. The prices seemed higher than ""normal"" but I would assume that it is because it is on the Strip. I asked for the animal style fries (which isn't shown on the menu on the top of the cash register). I was handed a cup so went to the soft drink dispenser to get my drink. I opted for Dr. Pepper since they didn't have the soft drink that I normally prefer which is Coke Zero. After a few minutes, they called out my number and I went to get my tray.

Even though there wasn't much of a line-up to order, the sit-in area was almost completely filled. I managed to get a seat when someone left. Cellphone reception was somewhat spotty inside the restaurant (I'm with T-Mobile) but the restaurant did have free wireless so I was able to update my status of Facebook as well as include pictures of my meal on social media.

When I finished my meal, I went to refill my drink and asked where the washroom/toilette was in the place and one of the employees informed me that there wasn't one inside the restaurant and I had to either go inside the casino or go to the public washroom within the Linq Promenade. Not knowing where the public washroom is within the Linq Promenade was located, I opted to walk to the casino to use the washroom and wash my hands since my burger was messy (but delicious).

Them not having a washroom inside the restaurant and their prices being higher than ""normal"" are the reasons why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",8,b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg

This West Coast Giant of Burger Making Greatness is, to me and most others, the king of the fast burger restaurant demographic anywhere on planet Earth.  Yes, even including Zimbabwe.  

Delicious, simple, delicious, fresh, delicious, messy, delicious and addictive.  And delicious.  It makes me wish I lived in a city with In N Out and grateful to Holy God that I DON'T live in a city with In N Out all at the same time.  

The meat, buns, cheese, sauce and veggies (lookin' at you, Animal Style!), and even the tightly-wrapped package, are all exactly what a quick, good burger should be be.

For the record, I'm a 3x3-Animal-style man, no fries, vanilla shake.  

This is our one-and-only ""must-do"" on our annual trip to Sin City.  One.  And only.  And we walk for it - about 30 minutes both ways.  And then wait in a crazy long, around-the-restaurant-and-out-the-door line.  It's all worth it.

Sometimes you worry that a place will never live up to the hype.  Like Slumdog Millionaire.

Well, you don't have to worry about that with In-N-Out Burger, because it is what all fast food establishments need to strive for.  It is the best of the best.  Clean restaurant, incredibly good service and staff, and most importantly the best fast food you'll ever find.

There isn't much I can say that is negative about In-N-Out.  I guess the only thing is that it's ALWAYS BUSY.  But the line moves really fast, and that's because the service is really good here.  Having a smiling happy and friendly staff goes a long way.  I just feel like your entire experience could change if you saw a long line and a bunch of miserable employees serving them.  I didn't see that, and I appreciated it.  I even asked for a bumper sticker (and felt bad asking given the rush inside), and the employee never gave me a single notion that he was annoyed about this special request.  He went to the back room and grabbed me two of them without thinking twice about it.  

Double double animal style, animal fries, neo shake.  That's how I roll.  The neopolitan shake is so thick that the flavors don't become one odd flavor, you get different flavors in every sip.  The burgers are nice and juicy and everything just works together really well.  I find fries boring, but not when they're covered in grilled onions and ""spread"".  

We made a point to eat here twice in a 3 day span.  I rarely eat fast food, but just couldn't help myself.  This particular location IS walkable from the south end of the strip.  Coming from the Trop, it took about 15 minutes.

It's not all because of the huge crowds, although that's part of it. The problem was that the service is shoddy, which should not be the case even at a busy location. On certain travel weekends, Kettleman City, located roughly halfway between the Bay Area and LA, gets pretty darn busy, but they can handle themselves. Here, they call orders prematurely and don't get all the fries ready. I also saw a woman with a serious enough complaint to get a coupon or something from the manager.

I placed the order while Gabriel stood close to the seating area ready to rush in for a table.

Not sure if the girl taking my order just came in because she was cheery as can be.  Not.  Maybe over whelmed 1st day on the job with the heat and the endless line of customers.  I'm surprised it didn't go out the door.  She took my order with some difficulty because the  noise level was so high. She did confirm my order of a 4x4, dbl dbl and animal fries. I also asked to load them up  with everything especially the fried onions.

I then walked over to the other side of the seating area.  This way we had both sides covered hoping we would get seats soon.  Then It happened.  A table vacated and I swooped in before the last person got out placing my rightful clam on the table.  Gabriel came over sat down while I loaded up on napkins, ketchup and those delicious hot peppers.

I used to frequent this location all the time when I attended UNLV and now normally only go here when I'm on or near the strip.  I much prefer this location over their Tropicana location because the patrons at the Tropicana location are usually drunk and rowdy tourists.  No thanks, I'll drive an extra few minutes to this one for a more enjoyable dining experience.  This location is always spotless and clean, the staff always friendly and fast.  
 
In-N-Out has a small and basic menu, but what they do have on their menu they always do so well.  The burgers I order are always very juicy, the buns always toasted to perfection, fries are always crispy (you can request extra crispy if you are in the mood), milkshakes always the perfect balance of sweetness.  The spread they use on their burgers are on a whole other level and are to die for.  I usually get the #1 meal which is a double-double burger (two patties) I opt to get my burger with the grilled onions on top too.  The meal comes with fries and a drink too all for $7.41 tax included.  If you've never been to In-N-Out before stop what you are doing and come here now.

It's about a 7$ uber ride during non prime times. So it's about a 14 dollar uber ride for a round trip. It's definitely worth I ubering the 14 bucks for your 8 dollar meal. 

Every time I go to Vegas this is the in n out I hit up. It's the one closet to the Las Vegas strip.

The animal style is always the way to go. It's a secret menu item that has lost its secret menu luster because it's not a very well kept secret. Everyone gets their burgers and fries animal style now and days. It's not on the actual menu so don't look for it on their official menu board. The animal style sauce is almost like a thousand island remix.

We waited in line for over an hour to get that first cheeseburger and fell in love on the spot! This day changed my burger life forever more.

Now to the present...I don't really visit this location often since I no longer live in this part of town.  When I do visit, I am usually pleased with my experience.  The food is consistent with the other In-N-Out locations, the service is the best, and the staff is unbelievably happy.  And yeah, the foo is totally delectable!

I do wish the parking situation was better at this location.  It is always really crowded and it is hard to find a spot.  The parking lot is also usually dirty with trash scattered everywhere.  This probably isn't In-N-Out's fault and more so the shopping center where it is located, but it is still a bit of an eye-sore.  Other locations I visit seem to always have someone out there picking up the parking lot, but I have never seen anyone doing that at this location.  

Also, I am really not comfortable leaving my car in the parking lot at night.  This neighborhood has just gone down a bit and there seems to be some shady looking people hanging out in the parking lot after dark.  If I am here after dark, I do the drive thru and head out of there ASAP.

i thought the burger was better than most other fast food places and the sauce they use for animal style was really good, but it was pretty ordinary for the majority of it.

the fries had kind of a stale recooked taste to them but weren't completely inedible with them being animal style i suppose.

there wasn't much business even with it being close to where one of the election's debates was being held. however, even with them having almost no traffic through their drive-thru and looking like they had little to no business inside, they were pretty slow at giving us our food.

I've tried it before in San Fran back in 2008, it was good but  did not impress me too much and I was not aware of Animal style.... fail...... so when I was planning a trip to Vegas, I had to make sure to revisit In-N-Out Burger and make sure my double double is animal style. I really enjoy the way the burgers are carefully crafted, every bite has everything i want in it, and it doesnt end up being a big mess that falls apart. From the crisp outer but soft innerds of the bun, freshly cooked patties, fresh veggies, and the flavors of animal style all mixed together to call for a completely enjoyable experience. I could have lived without the animal on the fries, did not enjoy that as much, just a little overboard, i think it was the carmalized onions that didnt mix well on the fries for me.

I reside in LA County home of the in n out burger,  and frankly as much as I love in n out, this location by far is not up to par with the many other locations I've been to. My girlfriend lives no more than 1 mile away, and today's experience has made me decide to review this place. 

First off,  the design of how the drive thru is makes it difficult for dine in customers to park on the side where it begins.  As the line gets long,  you would be stuck in your parking space with dumb drivers still blocking you as you're halfway out of your space.  Yes this just happened to me. 

Now for my food. Presentation is pretty much standard for all locations. I got my normal,  post workout meal of a cheeseburger,  mustard fry,  whole grilled onions and a double meat,  whole grilled onions and lettuce wrapped and man do I regret getting it lettuce wrapped.  The lettuce doesn't even wrap around the meats,  and for being whole grilled onions,  I got a measly two rings of onions???  Really?!  Ugh. My cheeseburger was alright I guess since pretty much tastes the same as all the other places I've been to.  

The workers were friendly so that's a plus,  and was quick to open an additional register once the dine in line became long. The workers and cleanliness off the location is the only thing that stopped me from giving this place 2 stars.

     I got in late tonite and decided, let's give it a go again. I got an order to go of 3, double-doubles with pickles and onions, an order of fries, and a chocolate milkshake.
     The order was ready pretty quickly (I went through the drive thru). It looked and smelled pretty good, but I was starving. My hotel is only 4 minutes away, so that was nice.
     I unpacked my order and it all looked tasty. Appeared very fresh. The fries were somehow a bit cold already, possibly stale. I felt like it had some black flecks on them, like when the fryer oil needs a change. They were ""eh"". Base off of this particular order, I wouldn't get their fries again, but I know it might occasionally happen.
     The burgers were quite large. Almost to the point of overstuffed, but because of the lettuce and tomatoes. The beef patties were cooked well and had a good taste. A bit of the problem with the over stuffing is the animal sauce made it VERY messy. The ratio of patty to everything else is a bit off. Eating the burger, a lot of it slides all over and you end up with kind of a wet handful of bun, sauce, lettuce, and tomatoes.

I was too lazy/disorganized to study up on the secret menu, and not overly hungry, so I ended up with a chocolate milkshake and a regular cheeseburger sans onions and tomato.  Through a communication error, I also ended up with a vanilla shake which I gave to my sister, though she never got around to drinking it.  Total cost - just over $6, which was pretty dang good!

The chocolate milkshake was nothing impressive, and I'd skip that next time.  The burger was surprisingly good for a fast food joint - much better than McDonalds and even preferable to my usual choice of Wendy's (not that I eat fast food burgers that often).

If you like ""normal"" burgers, then these burgers are pretty darn good.  ""Normal"" being cheese, special sauce, lettuce, tomato, onions.  Cheese melts well.  Beef is juicy.  Vegetables are fresh.  I'm not a fan of raw onions though.  Thankfully, they'll ask if you want onions each time.

However I much prefer ""specialty"" burgers over ""normal"" burgers.  Things like sourdough bread, onion straws, blu cheese, barbecue sauce, guacamole, and bacon are what I like.  In-n-out has none of these things as they maintain their 50s era vibe.

The fries are absolutely vile.  They have a weird glaze of vegetable oil on them.  They don't taste like potatoes; they simply taste like crystallized vegetable oil.  I simply abhor shoestring fries.  You can put as much junk on them as you want (""animal style"") and they'll still be nasty.

At least for me, I felt like less of an idiot and more like I knew what I was doing when ordering. I had a cheeseburger animal style, while my boy ordered a double-double, animal style, with a vanilla milkshake. We split well-done fries with cheese. Personally, I like my fries really crisp, and ordering them well-done was perfect considering cheese on top has a tendency to make them more soggy. They were awesome, and the cheeseburgers were probably the best I've ever had from a fast-food joint! The milkshake was good, but not outstanding (I'm not a huge milkshake fan, though). We really loved the whole experience, enough that I considered visiting again the next day. Decided my arteries couldn't handle it, so we will continue to dream of In-N-Out until our next west coast romp... sigh.",0,SigsctLKME5VJF_siTQ_5A

In-N-Out is the greatest fast food place of all time, and this location is no different. A line of cars wrapping around the building, out to the street. We still couldn't have waited in line any longer than 10 minutes. They whipped us (and our cab driver - thank you!) through the line in no time, with the outside order-taker helping immensely. She had no problem with the special orders (Tip: try the chopped chilis - incredible on a burger!)

I'm not usually one for buying into aura as much as I am just the food, but this place has something special about it. It's nearly a badge of honor to order something on their ""secret"" menu.

Where can you find a burger joint where all the ingredients are fresh, you can see the workers make the food while you wait for it in the drive thru and a secret menu to make you feel so exclusive you little hipster you!  In n  out doesn't need an extensive menu with new burgers and meals coming out every month.  They stick with a very simplistic menu which i respect a lot.  They know burgers. 

This particular location is no different in taste from the other in n outs which is good.  I've been to probably all of the different locations and consistency in taste and service is unrivaled.  I always get the same order which is the #1 double double animal style with chopped chilis, extra toasted bun, no salt in the burger or fries and if i'm feeling it the Neapolitan shake (which is amazing and if you're the adventurous time, dip your fries in it).  Orders come out pretty quickly considering the volume of customers. 

Coke products are available and their pink lemonade is awesome.  Nice and tart! I like to fill about 3/4 of my cup with sprite and finish it off with some pink lemonade.

When you order is done, they'll call your number and here is where you can enhance your meal even more.  ASK FOR SPREAD! its the special sauce they put in their burgers and i like putting extra and adding it to the fries! Also ask for a fork so eating the fries with the sauce isn't messy.  They have chilis by the condiments section, add these to the fries as well. 

Overall, one of the best quick bites that doesn't compromise quality with speed.

So my bachelor party was in Vegas and my one (main) request was that we eat here.  After a roughly 10 minute über ride from the strip, my wish was granted.  The inside of the building is very plain with little to no decor.  The menu is very small, with maybe 3-5 total items.  This isn't a problem though, as it probably helps with how quickly they're able to process each order.  
I had a Double Double, regular fries and a drink.  The burger was excellent.  Bun was soft and spongy and the meat was juicy, tender and flavorful just as I had been told.  This burger definitely lives up to the hype.  I am also a fan of Shake Shack and his was comparable
to their offerings.   The fries were kind of blah.  Nothing special, thin-cut fries just dropped in a fryer and served.  I tried a couple of my friend's animal fries and they were a little better but still did not meet my
expectations.

I dont like Mayo/thousand island based sauces and not a big fan of mustard+ketchup on my burger.  BBQ sauce and A1 are usually the only ones I'll use on a burger but most places use nasty cheap bbq sauce and dont offer A1.  So at many places I'll have my burger ""plain"" with no sauce which I believe has given me a ton of experience of what places are serving legit burgers that dont taste dry and flavorless without  sauce smeared on it... And In N Out is king at that regards. Their patties are made so juicy and flavorful you can easily eat it without their spread.
I dont like their fries but the burgers are so good and at such a good price I dont mark down my rating for that.  Also their shakes are some of the most affordable I've seen.

And lol at all the haters from the east coast who obviously had their mind made up that In N Out cannot possibly be better than their local favorites before trying them.

When you first enter the joint, it may look like you need to jump on the next available table while you're in line. But the turnover is fast. Tables become available readily. 

You can ask for extra (packaged) spread if you're really into their sauce. And the chili peppers are self service. As a tip, expand the white paper container so you can hold more chili peppers. They are meant to be expanded if needed.

We worked all day at the Convention Center and then we sat in a bar drinking some Johnny Walkers, when he said, ""Hey you wanna grab some dinner!"" Well this is Vegas and we always seem to find ourselves in some overpriced fancy restaurant on the strip spending way too much money for food.  In-N-Out was a perfect stop...I wish they would build one on the Strip.

It was fun to go with Kevin because he is a local California guy but he is the first California person to actually teach me something knew about  In-N-Out.  I have known about the secret menu for years but Kevin introduced me to the In-N-Out Hot Peppers...I had no idea we could get these for our burger and they were spicy hot.

I also think I might have taught Kevin something too...but he would not admit it.  He got his fries animal style and I got my fries well done.  We decided that it would have been amazing if we got them well done and animal style for the same order...I can not wait to try that.

The burgers were amazing but that is always a given...they work magic with there food.

This burger chain has been around for decades and I have never been to one that does not have a crowd with lines at the counter and cars backed up at the drive through.

This particular store has a separate merchandise shop and it is a fairly large property with more tables inside and out than a typical In-N-Out. There were also more parking spots and on the weekday afternoon I visited, the lines were manageable and my wait time from ordering to stuffing my pie hole was only about 10 minutes.

This location is close to The Strip so I imagine that there are times where the crowds and the wait are going to be terrible but the employees here seemed to be happy to be working and even came around a few times asking if they could get us anything else and clearing away our detritus and debris after the burger mauling that took place at our table. That kind of service I have not seen previously at other In-N-Outs so maybe they are trained to do that to keep people a bit happier while they have to wait. I did observe several locals that were very social with those of us visiting and they were all very proud of this particular location and they were really selling some foreign visitors on the food and the culture. Vegas should sign these people up as marketing ambassadors. I think by the end of the wait, the Japanese tourists patiently trying to hear their order number called were ready to denounce their own citizenship and move here based on the sales job from the local guy in line!

Which begs the question, is my love for In-N-Out just a function of it's relative inaccessibility or its excellent.  Probably a bit of both - as far as the In-N-Out on the Strip (on is also relative - sort of on more precise) goes you don't just get a great burger and fries - the place comes with a show.  By show I don't mean dancing girls (although I am not ruling it out) by show I mean ever single segment of society smushed into a small restaurant - mostly drunk - all hungry - at midnight - hangry for some seared beef perfection.  So there I am - dressed business casual - with multiple shirtless dudes, bachelorettes and whole host of Vegas finest - all congregating peacefully while waiting for our number to be called and shove the Double into our face.  The five star review may not be applicable at ever hour of the day - but at midnight after entertaining clients all day - eating practically nothing - the Double at In-N-Out is one of the greatest things in creation - and you need it Animal Style because of course you do and I don't really even know what Animal Style means.  The patties are cooked perfect - cheese is melty - lettuce and tomato super fresh - bun holds up to the beef and toppings and it is just the best late night meal.  Also went Animal Style on the fries - probs not absolutely necessary but yes on the burger.  As much as I would like to see In-N-Out move east - I think my preference is to maintain the mythical status of the once a year late night calorie explosion in Vegas when I never have to consider it just another burger.",0,m5fXkHqZDF5Jh0Cpn8F2Sg

Upon entering, there was a long line of hungry customers. However, the line went by fast. The cashier was so upbeat and friendly. First thing she said was a cheery ""Hi how are you!"" You don't get that kind of happy customer service at other fast food places.

I had perused the ""secret"" menu before coming here, so I knew what I wanted -- cheeseburger, animal style. The cashier suggested a ""combo"" so I ordered that. It came with fries and a medium drink.

Considering that everything is cooked up fresh, the wait wasn't too long. The cheeseburger was wonderful to look at - fresh, bright and tempting. One bite and I was in heaven~  The fries on the other hand were just so-so.

I got a to regular cheese burger with grilled onions and chopped pepers (peppers are not that spicy). This chain always toasts the bread to perfection. I took this burger home and was about a 15 minute drive and it was still hot and crunchy! 

In and out is not like other fast food burger joints. The taste and recipe have always stayed consistent since I was kid. They also make the burger right when you order it, so if you're dining in, be prepared to wait. 

The drive thru line is very efficient and fast.  Don't let the multiple cars fool you! There's always a staff member taking orders from you car that way it makes the lineore faster. There was probably about 8 cars in front of me and we waited about 10 min only. Super quick!

One thing is I tried to like the 'animal style' fries (ordered it two times now), but it is not good and a bit overrated. The price of the animal fries are about the same as a double-double and does not satisfy me. The dressing makes it soggy and sticky and I generally prefer the regular cut fries to be able to add to my burger or add on ketchup to it.

I've been once before and I wanted to make sure and try it again.  The wait wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at midnight.  Decided to park and order takeout from the counter.

Ordered a Double-Double animal style, animal style fries well done, and a Neapolitan shake.  It took about 10 minutes for the order to be filled so it's not necessarily fast food.  Took the order with me and went to my hotel to check in so I didn't get to dig into everything for another half hour.  The burger was very good.  Tasty and juicy, a decent size offering and very affordable.  The fries were another story.  I wanted to try them well done and by the time I got to them they were ROCK HARD.  Now I'm not sure if this was because I waited a half hour to dig into them or they are normally this way when you order them well done.  Even ordering them animal style did not soften them up.  I wasn't impressed with the fries the first time I went to In-N-Out so I guess my opinion has gotten worse.  The shake was good, nothing to go WOW about.

One one hand, their burgers are so much better than almost any burger out there, fast food or otherwise, and therefore should be a 5 star....but if I compare it to Fatburger, I'd say its only a 4 star...

Ah, heck with it, 5 star it is.  My only complaint about In-N-Out is the fries.  I don't know why I don't like them, I think that they're too fresh, as they taste too much like a raw potato to me.  Freeze them first or something!

The burgers themselves are just as good as Fatburger's, and are just plain amazing.  I typically go with Animal Style, but even the normal is great.

Service is 99.9% of the time great - most likely because this burger chain actually pays their employees decent wages and from what I have heard from friends who have worked there - the chain actually does have a good rapport with their employees.

Any In-N-Out I have been to is squeaky clean and employees are consistently cleaning the tables and floors - not just this specific one. At this one in particular I have noticed the drive-thru can start to get a little out of hand, but usually they will send out an extra person to start taking orders.

Why I love In-N-Out over most burger chains - their burgers have a crispness to them, the lettuce is not soggy, the tomatoes are fresh, you can get your onions grilled. The french fries are cut fresh (you can see them doing it). The shakes are very good. 

The menu is simple. Yet... we all know of the ""secrets"" behind what you can order at In-N-Out. I applaud them for not layering bacon and BBQ sauce and all kinds of other crap onto their burgers like so many other chains do. 

In-N-Out knows what they're doing and I appreciate that.

Overall I'm a fan of the Double Double with grilled onions. And their chocolate shakes. Damn good.

I teetered between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.

I like that they have a very limited menu. You have 4 options: burger, fries, soda and/or shakes. That limited menu allows for food to be made fresh and people too be served quickly.  I guess that is why they named the place in and out burger.  

You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.  You also can tell that they use fresh produce.  It was cool watching the guy peel potatoes for their fries.

I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well. 

Finally got around to trying the lemonade, and nothing special about it.

Two things make this a 4 star experience for me.  This first thing is them starting, to my knowledge, the secret menu!  I like ordering things animal style and doing the different variations that comes about from the secret menu.  Try eating a 4X4 burger...I enjoyed that all by itself!

They make hamburgers, cheeseburgers, double doubles (hamburgers with twice the meat) that all come with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a secret sauce.  They also have french fries, sodas, and milkshakes.  That's pretty much everything listed on the menu.  

However, those in the know can personalize their burgers in a surprising variety of ways.  My favorite option is protein style where the bun is replaced with a large pieces of crisp lettuce large enough to hold it all together.  Others will order theirs animal style with grilled onions, though I find this messy if you don't have a bun to absorb the extra liquid.  You can also skip the patty altogether and order a grilled cheese sandwich if that is more your thing.

I took a trip through the drive through at this location on my way out of Las Vegas.  I ordered my usual favorite - a cheeseburger, protein style, with ketchup instead of the sauce, with onions.  They made it perfectly.  The lettuce, onion, and tomato were crisp, and there was just the right amount of ketchup so that the burger was not dry nor was it soggy.  The fries were crisp, golden, and steaming hot.  I don't know what it is about the fries at In-N-Out, maybe the oil they're fried in, that makes them so tasty.",5,WqrwIIhDfNpf_B-K9jx4KA

Everyone talks favorably about the food and every time I drive by, they are busy...someone please explain!

Maybe I'm just having bad luck. The first time I went, the fries were overcooked, and the burger was just ok. So, I thought I'd give them a second try. I mean, there has to be a reason so many love it. 

So I went again a year later, and this time, the fries were not as overcooked, but still were just not that good. It's hard to explain, but they have a strange aftertaste or texture I can't place. I still ate them, but with catsup (which I NEVER use normally). 
But the big disappointment was the burger this time. It was so dried out. I was wishing there was more of their sauce on it to make up for the meat, but it was just not there. Sigh. 

Like I said, maybe this was just a fluke, 2 times, but I just don't get it. 
There is almost a cult like following of fans for this place, and I'm sure I will be hated by many for my review.

I enjoyed my inaugural In'N'Out experience.  The double double with fries was excellent.  For me, what sets In'N'Out apart is the freshness of the accoutrements - the lettuce and tomato were crisp and delicious.  The beef and cheese were tasty as well, but as a Chicagoan, I've had the same flavors at Billy Goat and Wolfy's.  They, like In'N'Out, have excellent, fresh ground beef.

The fries at In'N'Out are superior in that they are thin and crispy - thin yellow fries a la McDonald's, but fresher, and (sadly) much shorter.  What is up with half inch fries?  But that is a minor quibble to their usability.  They were quite tasty.  

What I loved most was the chocolate milk shake -- loaded with chocolate and very creamy.  A five dollar shake at half the price, and it did not even need the bourbon.

Before even entering this place is annoying because you have so many people bothering you for money. It's Vegas, I get it, but isn't fun dealing people essentially waiting for you to get out of your car to ask you for money. Then you go inside and you're in what seems like the longest line ever. Like a Disney(world/land) ride all for the burger and fries. Then if you eat in you've got to figure out where to sit. Good luck because this place is packed with tourist from all across the midwest essentially getting that elusive double-double.

So you order and get that double-double because it has that special sauce of theirs and some fries. I don't do it ""monkey style"" or any other of those weird secret menu things they may or may not have. I just want a burger and fries.

The burger is fine. Typical fast food burger, and I'll say that the meat is better than most, but the fries are the absolute worst. They are not cooked or something, like a soggy potato. Not good, not good at. I can't have a burger without having some fries with it and I can't eat these fries so I can't be a fan of this place.

If you have not been to In N Out, then you need to go there right now. Seriously. Here's what you're going to get: a double-double with everything, animal-style fries, and a shake. If you don't know what animal-style means, then you need to get online and search for their ""secret"" menu! The actual menu only consists of a hamburger, a cheeseburger, and a double-double. Also, please don't be one of those people who goes there, waits in line for 5 minutes, then has no idea what you want when you're up. I'll probably be the guy behind you saying ""Really? There are THREE things to pick from!""

Everything about In N Out is fresh. The meat is delicious, the bread is super soft, and the vegetables are crisp. For whatever reason, even their ketchup tastes better. The only thing I dislike a little about In N Out, and I'm aware I'm about to commit sacrilege, is their fries. They're good, but I personally like the fries at Wendy's or Jack in the Box more.

In the Student Union alone there are a few solid options (Metro Pizza, Panda Express, Subway...), plus the options within a block of campus (Jimmy John's, Aloha Kitchen, Chipotle...). Still, given all those tasty options, In N Out is the place to go. 

In N Out has the perfect combination of factors that I look for in a place to grab food: the wait is relatively short, the food is great, and prices are reasonable. Plus, they're consistently good - unlike some of the other places nearby where you sometimes get a great meal and sometimes don't (cough Chipotle cough). 

Now, let me get into what you should order in case you don't already know: Double Double, fries (animal style) and a shake. Sure, it's like 1500 calories altogether... but man you won't regret it at all. The burgers are really, really good, the cheese is perfectly melty, the onions and lettuce and tomatoes are perfect, and the bun is great, too. It's awesome. The fries, too, are probably the best fries you're gonna get. You can watch them cut and fry them, so you know how fresh they are.

At most every burger joint, I would order a hamburger with nothing but the meat and bun. No lettuce or tomato, no onion or pickles and definitely no condiments whatsoever... I know. You despise me. You think I'm a weirdo.

On rare occasions, I'd try something new, but a lot of the time--just the meat and bun, like plain vanilla. And here at In-N-Out, I'd either have that or a grilled cheese, fries, and a shake.

He might not be compelling me to eat a 3x3 animal style, but the biblical references on the wrappers and cups are conclusive evidence that he (or she) approves my fast food consumption. When it comes to Vegas locations, the Blue Diamond offers a fantastic experience that is worth whatever time out of the way it might be. 

The menu is simple. Its a burger that you come here for and the object of ordering at INO is to order off the ""secret"" menu or to try and stump or surprise the staff with a new concoction. If you think you are up to the challenge, try the 3x3 or the 4x4 which is exactly as it sounds three patties and three slices of cheese or four patties and four slices. Getting anything (except the shakes and your soda) ""animal style"" is clearly a must. Animal style throws on a slice of cheese, a thousand island style spread and onions.

The shakes are creamy and flavorful, don't even hesitate if the thought pops in your head to mix flavors. I personally enjoy the neapolitan. If shakes aren't your thing, be sure to get a icy cold coke, it goes beautifully with the burger and fries and just soothes your soul.

Service is good and the staff are incredibly spot on. The orders came out perfectly despite the complexity and the lines moved at a nice pace while still offering attentive service. It clearly puts its other fast-food counterparts to shame.

I mentioned that it is worth the time out of the way.

For 2 burgers, 2 orders of fries, a vanilla milkshake and 1 order of animal-styled fries (with grilled onions, thousand island dressing and cheese), our total added up to less than $15 and it fed 3 very hungry hannahs - stuffed and contented!

If you're a first-timer, you will find the menu a little too simple - at least that was what I thought 3 years ago when I was new in Vegas. Don't be too quick to judge. What makes In-n-out so interesting is the fact that they have a secret menu (envision a burger entitled 'the flying dutchman'!) and you can have it at a snap of a finger. Everything is served fresh, all the braches I've been to have been spotless and the staff always have a bright smile on their faces. At the same time, you get this whole 60s diner feel that I instantly associate with Johnny Rockets (and thus the comparison) every time I enter, only not with the dancing staff.

Apparently a lot of other people thought the same because there was a decent amount of people here at 4pm in the afternoon (too early for dinner).

Luckily with my too close for comfort stalking skills, I was able to snag a table for me and my group just as someone was about to leave. As in I stared them down while they hurriedly clean their table for me :)

The cheeseburger I got was pretty standard. Good as always. Cooked well, bread a tad crispy on the edges, fresh tomatoes and lettuce and just enough sauce to flavor it. Fries were good. I loaded them with black pepper and they were good to eat! (that's an understatement if you know how much black pepper I actually eat). And I got my usual half pink lemonade/half sprite mix. 

Overall, it was a good first meal of the trip even though the BF literally lives down the street from one in SD.

They have turned dining out into a simple experience. In N Out specializes in three sandwiches: a hamburger, cheeseburger, and double cheeseburger in addition to fries, Coke beverages, and shakes. It is simplicity in dining that is delicious. In N Out burgers taste freshly made. Missing from In N Out are microwaves and warmer lights.

  This past Saturday after exploring Craig Ranch Regional Park and hanging out in The Cannery my brother and I were up for a simple 4 star meal. The Cannery failed at that. It was now 11 p.m. And so we decided to meet up at the In N Out Burger a couple of lights from the Cannery and off the Interstate 15 exit. The abundance of parking and lighting gave me a simple first impression. It was an impression that would develop into a 4 star rating. The restaurant met my standards in cleaniness. The cashier was welcoming. In back of the cashier, the people cooking the burgers were in plain view. I appreciate the fact that customers can see the food being prepared. The time between ordering and picking up the food was 8 minutes. Yeah it wasn't exactly fast food, however, the taste exceeded fast food. An In N Out cheeseburger and fries is worth waiting for. The cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions was thick and tasty. I could believe that the burger was not frozen and microwaved. The fries were good, but in my opinion they cannot hold up to Chick Fil-A's or Nathan's.

  Speaking of animal style, in the fast food jungle, In N Out is an animal with the style of simplicity and efficiency. It is delicious fast food made simple. With the exception of a secret menu, there are only three meals to choose from. A hamburger meal, a cheeseburger meal, or double cheeseburger meal. It is simplicity made fresh. Forget about ordinary burgers being left under warm lights or frozen patties warming up in a microwave style device. At In N Out, they cook the burger right there and in front of the customer.

  Delicious fast food made simple is brings me inside the Blue Diamond Road In N Out Burger oftentimes when I am in the vicinity of the Target in the parking lot. Lol. Sometimes I go out of my way to do an errand in this Target just for an excuse to patronize In N Out. The thing is, it seems that on any given visit hundreds of people are also patronizing In N Out. The upshot us that I am rarely in n out. But then again I always dine inside. Regardless that I might be number 240 and they are serving customer 186; efficiency speeds up the wait. Due to supply and demand, In N Out is so popular that finding a table is as difficult as finding a cold day on a June in Las Vegas. Just like at any In N Out; I consider myself satisfied sitting at a bar chair. 

  On the subject of crowded, I observed that at In N Out; customers rarely seem agitated or annoyed. Ditto for the employees. The employees here are even friendlier than at casual dining restaurants that I have experienced. An example is last Saturday when I dined here, a friendly employee went up to all the customers asking how the food was and making small talk.

   In a City where there are countless restaurants to dine in, In N Out is the ultimate option. It is upbeat, inexpensive,  and delicious. When it comes to yelping this In N Out, I give it a 4 star bark :-)",8,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w

Two years later the First In N Out opened in 1948. Fast forward 71 years after the first Strip mega resort & 69 years after the first In N Out there was finally a link connecting the two icons. This link is spelled Linq. A couple of weeks ago, the Linq made headlines when this location opened as the very first In N Out on the Las Vegas Strip. 

  The first In N Out on the Strip is drawing in the crowds. And the demand is exceeding supply. The famous red, white, & yellow colors adorn a an average size eatery. During peak times there are insufficient  booths and patio tables. This was the case last time when I left disappointed. In hindsight I could of ordered to go then walked nearby to the Wildlife Habitat to have an In N Out picnic in the company of flamingos, ducks, and exotic birds. 

  The next week it was a different situation. On a rainy day we experienced the sunshine of In N Out when startlingly there were vacant booths. In N Out is fast food sunshine on a cloudy day & anyday. I have yet to see a gloomy employee in their restaurants. During the grand opening era, employees opened and closed the door for me. Now if I needed to use a restroom they would open and close the door for me because there are no restrooms leaving me  to use the public  one in the Linq. Across from the door in the open kitchen there were at least 29 employees greeting customers and creating the food. 

  Comparable to all In N Outs ordering is done with ease. The menu features 3 burger items that include lettuce, tomato, onions, & a thousand island style sauce. They are also offered as combos that include a medium Coke beverage and fries. The prices are higher than the other locations yet a bargain for the Strip. My cheeseburger combo came to less than $10 around the price of a beer on the Strip. It was $ well spent. Contrary to its namesake the food is never ""In N Out"" of a microwave or fryer. It was freshly made from the time of order causing a good few minutes of anticipation. The In N Out sunshine that permeated the delicious burger & fries was worth it. 

   In conclusion I anticipate a perpetual extraordinary busy In N Out. I foresee patronizing the local In N Out and leaving the a booth for the out of towner that craves In N Out. Now if there are a few available tables, there will be one for this local when he is craving In N Out.",13,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w

There are 2 classes of burgers, the thin patties, simple, clean flavors which In-N-Out serves. Then you have the restaurant gourmet burgers that tends to be big beef patties with lots of ingredients, more complicated, flavors aren't clean though. Both are still delicious. This is like arguing over Deep Dish Pizza vs Thin Crust pizza. Note that to pull off the simple flavors, it requires to have really good ingredients, which includes good meat patties, cheese, and veggies. In-N-Out usually does this well.

Like most other In-N-Out locations you usually will get great food and service. But the couple of times I went, I have some not so perfect service and food for In-N-Out standards. Despite this, it is still a lot better than some other fast food places.

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, burgers, shakes, or fries. But things get interesting when you start ordering off the secret menu. 

What I order now is: 3x2 Protein Style No Salt w/ Grilled Onions and Animal Style Fries. 1 less cheese makes it less filling. The lack of salt keeps the burger from drying out. The protein style is really so you can taste the ingredients, since the buns just get in the way.

I'd like to be able to go here more often to really explore the combinations of what I could do to the secret menu - but I find myself perfectly content with a double/double animal style with extra everything (sauce, pickles, lettuce, tomato and probably other stuff), well done fries with animal sauce (love that cheesy thousand island goodness), and a rootbeer float (covers both my beverage, dessert, and kicks the caloric count up another 1,000 points or so).

Theres a reason this place has so much lore to it - if you havent already, make it a point to go there.

And you'll probably see a lot of people from all over the world, since i've over heard many of them say they go straight here after the airport or that its on their to do list to come here.

My personal favorite is to just get a cheeseburger with no onions, light spread, one order of fries, all in a box with a lid. Reason being is that it seals up the moisture and makes the fries soft, that's just my personal preference, because down side is that the fries do get hard very quickly but its cuz they are made fresh.  But if you don't mind onions, i  would definately try it Animal Style. Its basically extra spread and grilled onions. You can made your fries animal style too.

This is the busiest location in Las Vegas. Since of course it right next to strip accross the strip. The longest i ever waited was 45 min to get my food after placing my order, but of course the line wrapped around all the tables in the restaurant.

OK for a quick bite? Sure.  Slightly better than a normal fast food place? Sure.  Perhaps 3.5 stars if I'm rating it as ""Fast Food.""  Overall though, even if there were I&O's near me (Central Connecticut), I can't imagine I'd eat there often.  I'd equate it to Skooters in Windsor Locks, and can quickly rattle off numerous other burger places I'd rather go (some pseudo fast-food like White Hut, Shady Glen, and Five-Guys, some real restaurants like Catsup & Mustard, Ted's Montana Grill, Bobby Flay's Mohegan, Red Robin). 

FOOD:
I don't get it. A lot of hype, if you ask me.  The burgers were better than normal fast food, sure, but they weren't really that great.  The texture is nice and pleasing, and it  tasted a bit more like beef than McD's/BK, but that's not saying much.  

And the fries...blech.  Flavorless shoestring.  I have a nearly offensive level of appreciation for ketchup, and the fries made me ALMOST say ""screw it"".  The fries at Five Guys are much much better. 

SERVICE:
Ordering was quick, but the wait after wasn't.  We had to wait absurdly long because their printer stopped working, and the guy I assumed was the manager didn't notice since he was busy flirting with a customer, (While the place was packed...flirt on your own time, not mine. Thanks.).  

Cleanliness was pretty damn good for a fast food place, particularly considering how crazy busy it was...I have to give them that. 

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
It peeved me that for our takeout they just threw ketchup packets on top of uncovered fries.  Thanks for reaching your dirty mitts into the ketchup packet bin, and dropping it all right on my food. Sure I'm going to be touching those potentially dirty packets with my fingers, and then eating with the same hands...but I don't need I&O skipping that step. 

Next time I'm on that side of the country it'll be Fat Burger time. A little birdie tells me that place is better than In and Out.",0,mm1d-9b1XFlUavSYsxTvYg

Burgers - They are well-known for a reason! In-N-Out burgers are freshly prepared with 100% pure beef patties that are cooked to order. The patties are well-seasoned and juicy. Toppings include tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and onions. Their special sauce (mayo, mustard-like) is delicious and adds great flavor to the burger.

Animal-Style Fries - Another distinguisher of In-N-Out are their ""animal-style"" fries. Their fries include freshly-cut potatoes topped with their secret spread and grilled onions.

2791,7dHYudt6OOIjiaxkSvv3lQ,0,2011-10-27,0,R7a22v7gOjqT__53wofmtA,3,"The menu at In-N-Out Burger is as simple as it gets: you can order a hamburger, a cheeseburger or a double-double (double meat and cheese), which are served with or without fresh or grilled onions. Fries and soft drinks are also available, as are three varieties of shakes, but that's about it.

So what makes a visit to In-N-Out something many visitors to Vegas have to do? Aside from the fact they use natural, fresh ingredients, keep their restaurants very clean, and treat their employees very well, they've also created a mystique about themselves by limiting their stores to California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, and developing a cult-like following of carnivores in the process. While their burgers are superior to what you might find at the fast food outlets run by a shifty clown or creepy king, some describe their burgers and shakes as fast food bliss, and it's not uncommon for some guests to make it their first stop in Vegas from the airport while en route to their hotel.

Price is also a factor, as you can easily feed two for under $15, and for as little as $10 if you don't want to gorge yourself.

And then there's the whole ""secret menu"" thing. Walk up to the counter and ask for your burger ""animal style"" and receive extra pickles, extra spread (their secret sauce), grilled onions and mustard fried onto the patty. Or ask for a grilled cheese sandwich, or a protein-style burger (served without the bun), or opt for their 3x3s or 4x4s (three burgers and three slices of cheese, or four burgers and four slices of cheese). While a 44 is the maximum, some stores will allow their zealots to go a little crazy with orders for a 2020, and an infamous 100100 was once ordered right at thilocation here in Vegas.

Unfortunately, there's no In-N-Out Burger located strip side, so you will need a car to get to one. If you've rented a car, your best best is taking a quick, two-minute drive behind New York-New York on South Dean Martin Drive just off West Tropicana Avenue (route 593). Walking there is not advised. Don't do it.

If you don't have a car, taking a cab is always an option, but I would recommend heading to the location at 2900 West Sahara Avenue to avoid traffic and for getting the most bang for your buck. It's a $15 cab ride (each way) from the middle of the strip, but you can make the most of your trip by stopping into Palace Station, which is just down the street. 

You can also save the cab fare and get to this In-N-Out location using public transportation. Just hop on the Strip and Downtown Express Bus heading north from one of its many strip-side stops, and transfer onto the 204 at Sahara and Santa Paula heading west. This trip will cost $5 (which will let you use the city's buses for two hours), or spring for the 24-hour pass that is a bargain at $7 and will give you enough time to explore downtown Vegas and the Fremont Street Experience, the World Market Center, and the Las Vegas Premium Outlets the next day, and meet a bunch of interesting characters on your travels. Just stay away from the shifty clowns.",2,DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ

I waited all day in my only day in Vegas to make the trek walking from the Strip over to eat the burger I had heard so much about: double-double animal style. Was this likely the best decision before attempting to run my first ever half marathon? Likely not, but we'll look past this for now.

The trek, while a touch long, especially if you're trying to conserve your energy and legs for a run, is not impossible. There are a few tricks to the walk, including making sure you're walking along the same side of the street as the Excalibur and non New York, New York on your way across the freeway. When the sidewalk splits, make sure you take the right path, not the left, as this will lead to the bridge over the freeway.

Anyway, enough about walking there and on to the food. At 2 pm in the afternoon, the place was packed, but the cashiers moved through the line efficiently. Within 5 minutes, I was up at the front and placed my order for a double-double animal style with fries and a vanilla shake. 

I then proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for my order to be made. The burger definitely didn't disappoint. Nice and juicy with good flavors. Best burger ever? Not even close, but for a fast food burger, it definitely ranks up near the top.

The fries, however, were disappointing. Little flavor. For a fast food fry, I have to give the edge to Five Guys on this one.

Lame, limp, and tasteless. Even ordering well done fries just makes sure they're not cold when you're done with the burger.

At a place where they hype the freshness of the ingredients, the milkshakes are on tap from a machine.

If you're from California, chances are that you OMG TOTALLY LOVE THIS PLACE. Put an In and Out Burger in the Midwest and you'll see it die a quick death because they're just NOT that good.

The place is quite obviously a stripped down Steak 'n Shake since they opened 15 years later.

In a prefect world, Fatburger would control every In and Out location since they are superior in every way.

If you know what real food should be, then eating here will just make you doubt mankind's superiority as the dominant species on the planet. 

If you, like the majority of Las Vegas, think that Taco Bell makes the best tacos, you'll love this place.

For a chain that arguably serves up one of the best, if not THE BEST, burgers in the nation... In-N-Out Burger has also become known for their non-""fast"" food service.  That's ironic considering their menu options are the fewest of all quick service joints...single or double patty, with or w/o cheese, fries, shake and/or beverage.

Their double cheeseburger is one of the greatest things California has ever given to America.  Get it animal style, their most famous secret menu item, and you'll have pure awesomeness on a bun!

Also, the shakes are like 50% foam. What's up with that?

You know, I always stay clear away from all fast food places whenever possible.  My kids and wife like burgers and we have tried all the latest places. From 20.00 burger places down to 1.00 dollar specials.  In the end, ya cannot beat Inn N Out on a regular ""gotta have it"" basis.

1.  The experience - Sure the other places are good to try out and have a completely different ambiance. I agree. Yet dollar for dollar the food here is comparable to most I have tried in all the places here in Vegas.

2.  The price - You cannot beat the prices. For a family of three, you can easily spend under 20.00.  

3.  Parking and Access- Okay, this particular Inn N Out is on Serene and Eastern near the 215 in a strip mall. It's entrance is just before a huge freeway onramp. This makes turning in with raging drivers behind you a challenge at best. Now I am not sure why we see so many strip malls empty and with parking spots that look brand new after 5 years or more, but this place is always very busy. Parking can always be found, but perhaps not directly in front of the restaurant. 

4.Take Out - They seem to focus on getting the take out customers and the car line moving, so even though it may seem very long, it moves fast.  They do a great job of having a server walk out with a remote ordering system and getting to each car faster than the car getting to the ordering kiosk.  The only issue is that the lines can wind around the parking lot and can be a bit confusing.

5.  The FOOD - There is some great stuff on the menu and many not on the menu...

Shakes - Great, tasty, perfect texture and thickness!

Burgers - This is the best.  
Onions - Be sure to tell them grilled, raw or none
Cheese - You can specify how many, the default is one
Lettuce - FRESH and CRISPY!
Tomato- Big hunking slice. 
Meat - The perfect size. You can have a single, double double which is 2 patties and 2 cheese.
Protein Style - Wrapped in lettuce, without the bun

Not on the official menu - Here is a small sampling, I am sure there is more!
Animal Style - A Cheeseburger with mustard, extra sauce, pickle and grilled onion.
3 x 3- Three patties and three cheese
4 x 4 - You know the drill
Flying Dutchman- I haven't tried this one, but it is two patties and a cheese, that is IT.
Fries Animal Style - Yep you got it.

Before when I'd come to Vegas, I would hop a cab over to the In-n-out to satisfy my craving for the fatty juicy burgers that would be adding greatness to my handles of love. And then, when there was Lyft/Uber, I started ridesharing it to this fine fast food establishment.  

Now I can just cross the friggin street to get a double double or two. Yes, I'll have fries with that.  

Definitely one of my favorite fast food burgers. So the fries are fresh and crispy, the burger is tender and juicy and the service is top notch. Nice fresh tomato slices and pieces of lettuce to boot.

Parking: although most In-N-Out Burgers in Las Vegas have ample parking, they tend to always be full! And yes, that includes the line inside!

On a recent visit, I befriended a trucker from Boise, Idaho who had made a pit stop at In-N-Out Burger! He had told me he was on the road for hours and said he couldn't wait for this particular pitstop! I was a bit surprised, but he said there aren't any In-N-Out Burgers where he lives! And there aren't any on his usual truck routes! Wow, and I had thought In-N-Out was everywhere! I had also noticed a lot of the cars in the parking lot were out of state license plates ranging as far as the east coast, south, Midwest and the west coast! They come from all over just to experience these mouthwatering burgers, French fries and milkshakes!

On this visit while waiting for my order I conversed with people from Maryland, New York and Tennessee and they, too, look forward to In-N-Out Burger as they do not have locations in the south or east coast that they are aware of.

For those staying downtown this is the closest location (from Main Street head towards Las Vegas Blvd South and make a right on Sahara Ave).  This location may out of the way of the Las Vegas Strip, however, it is also not as crowded and frequented by visitors as much as the one off Tropicana Ave. One reason being this location does not have the souvenir shop. But if you're going just to satisfy your craving, be sure to check this location out the next time your in Vegas! Don't get me wrong, this location can still fill up too, however, the locations closest to the Las Vegas strip are frequented by a lot of tourists from all over too. :)  Being from Hawaii, I always look forward to In-N-Out Burger! Still crossing my fingers for a location to open up in Honolulu, Hawaii.

People who have never been here always tell me, ""small menu?"". Yeah, small menu, but big on taste! If you're doing it right, you don't need a big menu! The burgers are always juicy and mouthwatering!  The French fries are always  crisp and fried to perfection! I have since learned there are items you can order that ARE NOT on the menu board! Whaaaat? You gotta find out or ask someone who knows! Yummy!!! As always, I always order the Double-Double Meal A, with a side order Double-Double whenever I am here! (Haha). The milkshake is also to die for! 

There's only so much I can describe a fast food chain burger, but you gotta try it to believe it! Juicy, delicious and mouthwatering!

Most In-N-Out Burgers in Las Vegas have ample parking, however, they can fill up pretty quickly especially during lunch and dinner/late night hours. The line inside to order may appear long as you walk in but I've noticed they tend to move fairly quickly.

Some information for those who may be staying in a hotel on the Strip without a car, as I was this time, and are wondering about walking to In-n-Out, as I did. It is doable as long as you take the right approach.  

If you are coming from Las Vegas Boulevard (the Strip) and want to walk down Tropicana Avenue over top of the I-5 freeway, you must stay on the south side of Tropicana Avenue. That is the side with the Excalibar Hotel as opposed to the north side with the New York New York Hotel (and Casino, but that is superfluous in any Vegas hotel name).  When you get to the street across from In-n-Out, you cannot cross Tropicana immediately but must cross Dean Martin Boulevard, then Tropicana, then Dean Martin again.  The direct route has no crossing signal.  Why did you have to stay on the south side of Tropicana when In-N-Out is on the north side?  You will come to a spot without sidewalks, and in that traffic you do not wish to take your life into your hands.

The good news about the walk?  The food is worth the trip,and you can feel virtuous enough from exercising - hey, you burn calories in the 100 degree heat - that you can add a milkshake without guilt.",1,pD_W9KOdAOGhAV2_9UsfqQ

I ended up going with a two-by-two animal style with fries and a drink. Service was quick and the main guy at the cash was super nice, chatting about menu items with me. The restaurant itself wasn't too busy when we arrived but was very clean and well lit, if a tad sterile. 

Yes, this burger lives up to all the hype. No, the fries don't (perhaps if I'd gotten them animal style, they would have, but they were just ok), but the burger is really the gem here. I'm really sad we don't have these in Canada and I'm hoping they either bring them up or that I head to the states again soon to try another one! BOMB burger! Yum!

We were worried we would have trouble getting a cab back but we happened up on a cab driver coming back out of In-n-Out so we got a ride with him.

The burger though, it was sad, I asked it if it had had a death in the family, it didn't even crack a smile. 
 Maybe because I always get the Double, but this poor thing could have been vegetarian! Paper thin meat, I always get extra onions, and even that wasn't a lot! It was just sad. The fries weren't hot! i have NEVER bumped into that before at an In-n-Out, however I didn't ask them to fix it, and I know they would have. They happiness of the server made up for the sadness of the burger.
 It was clean, and twice someone came out to clean again, even though they were slammed!
 Always try to go when it isn't Lunch or Dinner rush! They run out of tables very quickly. Not a rush time and it's golden.
 I asked the family next to me and they said the shakes are really good, I have never tried one, but will next time.

""I have only fallen in love three times in my life, and the first bite of that Double-Double was one of those times. The crispy bun complimenting the cool lettuce, the special sauce accentuating the fresh tomato, the sweet meat mixing with the salty cheese, all of it coming together in a harmonious medley of flavor thus far unseen on the American fast food landscape - I was smitten. It was the single greatest fast food meal in the history of civilization. Even though I was full, I immediately ate another Double-Double.

Of course their food was wonderful as usual. A Double Double with fries and a vanilla shake. Why order anything else?? There is the usual seating and some outdoor seating as well. It is a bit limited during peak times but there are plenty of bench style seats just outside within the LINQ area.

The burger was hot and delicious. They have this ""special"" sauce, I don't know what it is, but it was amazing! I don't like it on my burger, but I asked for it on the side, which they had no issues. It is great on fries. The fries were thin, perfect for me. They were hot and crispy. They didn't seem to have any salt on them, but I think that's good since some people need to watch the salt. 

The prices are not bad at all. It was less than 20 for two burgers, two fries, a shake and large drink. I think its the west coast's version of McDonalds and boy it is a thousand times better! We will go every single time we are on that side of the US.",1,LHfU_E6zU1ahQj5Gdh1-WA

Their menu is so simplified that there's no small, medium, or large. It's just one size. There was a long line and the restaurant was almost packed. This was around 1pm on a Thursday.

We ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a vanilla/chocolate mixed shake. The burgers are huge. I could barely fit it in my mouth. It comes with lettuce and tomato for only $2.45. It was delicious with their house sauce that they put on it, kind of like Thousand Island. They gave a generous portion of fries for $1.65. Their fries are crispy and not greasy at all. I seen them fry it in the fryer, but it's as if it was air fried. It's one of the best tasting fries out there. Their shakes are thick and creamy, not overly sweet for $2.20. The hubby and I were fighting over the fries and the shake the whole time we were in the rental car. We should have just gotten our own but I didn't know how good it was going to be. I thought that it was going to be your average fast food.

I saw people ordering fries topped with their house dressing, cheese, and grilled onions. I didn't see it on their menu. I asked around and come to find out that it's called Animal Fries. In-N-Out Burger has this secret menu where you get extra stuff on your food because their menu is so basic.

After two months of hard dieting and working out I needed this indulgence. Nay, I wanted this. I had to have it. The beast within would not be denied.

So easy to get to by cab as it is close to the strip and they are pretty much running back and forth there every few minutes. Quick ride from Bally's and it was easy to grab one back as they are constantly dropping off in the parking lot. Even late at night it was bustling.

Protein style double double, animal style fries, neopolitan shake. Hellz yeah!

I sat down at a table with my feast and engorged my fat ass to my heart's delight! Yes, the guilt and dread after eating this made me hit the gym in the morning to burn off all the fatty calories. 

Is it overhyped? Sure is, and it's not as good as many claim. Shake Shack in NYC is a better tasting burger. Still, you go for the freshly made food here and the ability to order off the not so secret menu which is part of the fun novelty of In-N-Out. That, and the diverse crowd that populates this place.

I wasn't hungry so it's my fault for ordering what I ordered: The hamburger combo: burger, fries & drink for around $5.60. Cheap eats. Maybe that's part of the appeal.

I made a rookie mistake. Since I have never been to an In-Out before here is my advice for future newbies like me: Get the Double, Double. You might as well get it animal style too (grilled onions, spread & mustard seared into your patty.) 

While I appreciated the abundance of veggies in my burger it completely lacked any flavor. My fries was also cold by the time I received my order. Like it was sitting out two minutes too long on the counter. I know because I was watching the prep action. It seems each worker is assigned to a station responsible for only one or two things. It appears whomever was responsible for getting the finished product out to the customer was sleeping on the job. SO my cold fries was not good which only made for a more disappointing experience.

Don't know if I would go back since there are other burger joints I would like to check out next time. Shake Shack & Five Guys is going on my to-do list.

I waited at the first window to pay, but nobody was there.  Then someone finally said to pull up to the next window...when I got to that window, the guy had no idea which order was mine.  I had to tell him what I ordered, and then he gave me the bill.  Then almost forgot to give me my drink after I got all my food.

Consistency is usually great at In N Out...this time, the bread was over grilled, so it was crunchy.  Something petty to complain about, but since I have never complained at an In N Out before, I might as well do it now.

B. The quality IS lacking here. I understand they need to have a quick turnaround time, but for goodness sakes, leave the fries in that last minute.

They never skimp on the fries here. We really like that. I also like that I don't need to order my fries well done to avoid sogginess. Soggy fries are not welcome here- just ask the Fry King.

No, it isn't the best, meatiest, most original burger ever, and the fries are kind of soggy sometimes and forgettable, but all that is meaningless when you pull in, expecting to either stand around and cast a hawk-eye for any soon-to-be vacated seats in the crowded eatery, or resign yourself to consuming your greasy feast in your car, made that much better by In-N-Out's well-executed cardboard container trays. 

I like the reputation of In-N-Out for being a good company, who treats it employees well and pays them decently. I like how this reputation seemingly trickles down to my actual experiences with the employees, who are always chipper and efficient (sans Chick-Fil-A's sometimes eerily robotic, hyper cheeriness). I like that the restaurant I frequent when I'm in Vegas always seems to be quite clean, and that the price is so reasonable for a luscious burger and fries with a drink ($7 and some change). I appreciate the nifty cardboard container trays that display your food neatly so you can consume on-the-go, in your car, or if necessary, standing up because there are no seats available. And goodness, that legendary ""Animal-style"" burger is so, so delicious: two thin, crispily-laced burger patties, cool crunchy pickles, melty hot cheese, grilled onions that manage not to reek, and richly fatty sauce, all sandwiched between two warm, soft but sturdy buttery/toasted buns. Add those little shoestring fries and an ice-cold Diet Coke and I am SO HAPPY. And, although the feast is a caloric bust, I don't feel gross and sickly like I do after eating at most other fast food chains.

The Good:
This is a popular place, but the line moved swiftly. The employee who took our order was very nice and happy!! It's a pleasant change from the sterotypical down-trodden fast food worker.

In order to get the real In-N-Out experience, you must google the secret menu. I ordered the Flying Dutchman with lettuce and tomato (a double cheeseburger minus the buns), Joe had a double double animal style (a double cheese burger with their sauce, onions, pickles), and an order of cheese fries lite well (fries cooked just a little longer so they are crisper with 2 slices of American cheese on top).

Oh my gosh, the food was so fresh and so delicious!!! Our meal costs $12.02. That is a STEAL for a meal for 2 in Vegas that isn't McDonald's!


Could improve: 
Knowing you have to look up the secret menu for the full experience.... or else you are getting just a plain hamburger/cheeseburger.

Cleanliness in the dining area. It's not that the resturant was totally unclean, it's just that this resturant was hoppin' and there was a lot of foot traffic, and some people don't clean up after themselves. There were several employees running around and cleaning up, so they were definitley trying!

Also, some chili on those fries would have been tasty ;)


The bad:
Nothing!!!

Unfortunately, it took me 10-15 minutes to get my food even though all I ordered was a cheeseburger with no onions and animal style fries with no onions. People that ordered way after me that had huge complicated orders received their food before I did. So I was kind of put off by that right away.

Still, it IS an In-N-Out, and less than perfect is still way better than the other fast food competition.
Other people in the area agree, the line out the door and the line for the drive-thru going out into the street and almost to the I-15 on ramp while the other fast food neighbors are pretty dead is telling: everyone loves In-N-Out, including famous chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain.

Except my ever hungry friend.

He wasn't impressed. He expected a large menu of every burger combination possible complete with foie gras and shittake mushrooms.
Sorry, this isn't that sort of place. Here they keep it simple, honest, and fresh. 
He didn't get it. It's not gourmet fanciness, it's just a good burger and freshly cut fries.
If a place doesn't have dancing Asian midgets and a full appetizer menu on which he could order the whole page at a time it isn't for him.
I can't blame him though, this location wasn't as good as I've had before, but it was close enough since we'll probably never see one of these on the east coast ever..

I'm happy to say that In-n-Out was worth the time I've spent listening to the countless tales of its ultra-juicy, delicious, ""best burgers ever"" and I can confirm that it lives up to its title.

We were staying at Mandalay Bay and ended up getting on the bus headed the wrong way. Lucky for us though, we realized it right away so we were planning to get off and hitch the bus going the other way, when we saw a giant sign that said In-n-Out burgers 1/2 mile down Maryland. Somehow our slight detour fared better for us because I've heard about how busy the Dean Martin one is and the one we went to by UNLV only had a few people there. Score!

I had been practicing what I was going to order from the Secret Menu so I didn't go in there looking like a newbie. I had it down pat. Two double doubles, animal style and an order of well done animal style fries. BOOM! It looked like I'd done this before. I'd read a lot of reviews about how the fries were nasty, but they were pretty good smothered in thousand island, onions and cheese AND cooked extra crispy. Not bad at all. 

The burgers were the true winner though. I want to overnight ship about 100 of those back home so everyone I know can experience this. This may sound dumb, but the cheese they use on their burgers is not the traditional Kraft cheese. Oh no, this was some extra tasty cheese-- no offense, Kraft. The burger, well you could tell that it was fresh and not frozen. It was very melt-in-your-mouth good.

The food is still decent, especially at its price point, but its not something I'm
looking forward to on future trips.

The bun tasted stale. What happened to that buttery toasty yet soft carb pillow from before? The tomatoes tasted old like they were overripen ...from a few days ago. I could barely taste the burger as if there was no seasoning and the meat wasn't fresh - did my taste buds not make it through customs? The fries were soggy, stale, and lacked seasoning. The ONLY redeeming thing about the food was the animal style. If I could order a burger and fries animal-style hold the burger and fries, I would.

We are always pleased to find these joints when heading out west since they are nowhere to be found on the East Coast. 

We went in around 1115 on a weekday thinking 1. people wouldn't be awake yet, or 2. it was too early for lunch. Boy were we wrong on both accounts. It was packed, but the line moved quickly. Soon it became a ""who is quicker"" competition for trying to find a table. For the amount of customers they get, they sure need more seating when the weather isn't that nice outside. Luckily we found a table quickly and our food arrived shortly after (maybe 10 minutes or less).

The burgers were delicious with the grilled onions and special sauce. The fries were a bit cold and stale so I think we would have rather gotten bigger burgers and passed on the fries. The milkshake was super thick to drink through a straw. Walking around with it, the consistency thinned out and we were able to enjoy them.

They were the saltiest fries I've ever tasted and wish I'd ordered a drink because I sure needed it after all the salt.  The bun on the burger was okay, just average.  I prefer a sesame seed bun. Maybe I should try one of the ""off the menu"" variations and find my sweet spot.  But for this first visit, I was totally underwhelmed and the price was too high - $2.25 for a burger.  That's too high for fast food which isn't even ""fast"" in that you do have to wait for a few minutes while they prepare the food.  I may try again....I may not.

Glass was pretty clean and everyone working had on a hair net and was wearing gloves. The staff members were organized and it seemed like they were having fun due to the laughter within their face.

I feel like they are going down-hill and not only that but their prices are getting higher.  I was surprised when I saw how much they increased the prices.

The ""secret menu"" enhances the already delicious burgers. Animal style consists of grilled onions, their house sauce (think thousand island), and cheese. It is artery clogging goodness. Protein style burgers come without the bun and wrapped in lettuce. I convince myself that by cutting out the bun, I am doing myself a great favor and ignore the calorie overload I am ingesting.  

The burgers are the main star and surpasses all other chains in flavor and value. The fries are my least favorite because they are too starchy. That is the problem with fresh cut fries, they do not get the time to soak and draw out the excess starch. By making them animal style makes it easy overlook this problem.

If you're like me and love the sauce, be sure to ask for more. They have it in packets (no charge) and make sure to order the pink lemonade.

The waits are long, almost 30 minutes sometimes. You do weird things like put bible verses on your packaging. Your sauce is ~mysterious~ And still, I always come back.

Five Guys and Smashburger both give you a run for your money. But to get a double-double with fries and a drink costs less money than a basic burger at those two places. Mind you, that's before the fries and the drink.

The milkshakes are Ixcacao-approved contraptions! The special sauce is probably the closest you'll ever see to me eating anything with a mayo-base. You season and blend it well enough with whatever else you use in it to take away that icky mayonnaise taste from it.

The long waits for your food show your dedication in making a quality product. The long lines show that it is indeed something worth waiting for. The fact that you, a California institution, sees Nevada as a worthy contender for expansion shows your generosity. 

I practically grew up on you, In-N-Out. And for that, you'll always have my heart. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
In-N-Out
Quality.
A local institution practically.
Milkshakes to die for.
A secret menu that goes on for days. 
Retro decor. 

Cons: 
Not open 24 hours.

Best cure for a hangover ever.    This place is right off the strip so it's kind of too far to walk to, but you can see it right over the highway.

In & Out is what some would consider Las Vegas's Chick-fil-A [since we don't have one of these fine establishments].

Yes, the point is to get in, get your burger and get out, but they do nothing better or more quick than McDonalds, Burger King, Jack in the Box or Wendy's and yet they have an infinitely smaller menu.

What makes them so special? Yes the 4-item me unis intended to keep things quick, but again, it moves no faster than other fast food places so why not just go somewhere else where you have more options...?

My family and I were really disappointed by this place and hopefully at least the food was great or something, which would help to make it better than other burger joints, but that's not even the case.

Lately I've noticed that even though they may have fresh burgers, a 'cool' 'secret' menu (that everyone knows about) they have quite a few problems that have been adding up to my annoyance over the years.
I've lived right up the street from this place for 18 years, so I was there when it first opened up (and it was a big deal to the community, no more shall we have to drive down to Lake Mead!) and have seen them develop over the years.
1.) Service has gotten worse, the wait time is ridiculous, and to make it more of an insult they have an actual timer for you to watch while you wait. This applies to when it is busy (which I can understand to a POINT- fifteen minutes at the LAST window? Not cool) and when you  come at 11pm at night and wait 10 minutes for your fries and milkshake. I'm sorry, but it has gotten ridiculous over the years, the amount of waiting I have to do inside and outside (inside is worse by the way) so much so that when I went to one in San Francisco (one that had TWO lines by the way) I expected to wait half an hour, but it turned out it took less time to get us through there than it does here at this location when there is only one person in front of you. So it is not an overall In N Out issue, it is THIS place's issue.
2.) Prices have gone way up. End of story.
3.) It is not unresonable to ask for a grilled cheese to be grilled away from the burgers, on the other grill. Escpecially not when there is an actual option for it. So when I ask, and I find meat chunks on my grilled cheese, I know you did not, in fact, grill it on the other grill. This ties into a very important reason why I no longer come to this location: They rarely listen to what you want, if it is outside of the ""Double Double no onions"" deal. More cheese? Maybe. No salt on your fries? Perhaps. Half strawberry half chocolate milkshake? Kinda. If they can't hold up to their 'secret' menu, then they should not have it as an option.
Other locations are way better.",4,g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw

In Vegas you get tired of fancy eating after a while, even more when you have Joel Robuchon on your list for the week of restaurants. So In n Out came as a welcomed relaxed, smacking good meal.  My husband had already advised me that taxis go in and out of In n Out all the time, so we let our taxi go not before having been told by about three locals, ""oh, your going to get real good food now"" of course when we came back to the hotel and they saw me with my drink cup all the valet people asked what we had brought them from In n Out.  It is no coincidence that In n Out is so famous.

They use really good clean oil for their fries which come out, without fault, light yellow and crispy.  For ladies I suggest the single burger and for guys the Double Double. The Monster Fries are not on the menu, as are about 7 other articles, that are secret knowledge of only the  real fans of the chain restaurant. We had the monsters last time, which are like a double dose of fries drenched in their special pink sauce which they also put on their burgers, I think.

I had the number two which was the cheeseburger, fries, and drink combo. My boyfriend had the number one which was the double double, fries, and drink combo and he got his fries ""animal style"".

Wait, that is exactly what most California transplants do. I have to say I just don't get it. We happened to be doing In-N-out burger for lunch at work today and I was going to pass and just grab something from the bakery next door but I decided to see just how unlike in n out I could make the burger and well.... It worked. They made my burger exactly how I asked for it, a double double, mustard grilled, with chopped hot peppers.. Yes I said chopped hot peppers and animal style. 

Now that you have swallowed that In-N-Out put hot peppers on my burger I will just put it out there. In-n-Out is Ov-er-rated. The burgers are not anything that stands out as being all to spectacular and the fries even when you request well done fries so they come out crispy instead of mushy they are still lack luster. My recommendation would be to take out a personal loan from your bank and hit up the nearest fat burger.  

Basically it is safe to say that if you have never been to an in-n-out you may want to try it to build your own opinion but it is nothing that really makes me say wow.

If I was given the option to live off of one food for the rest of my life, it would probably be a cheeseburger. It's the one and only food I feel justified reviewing. So let me tell you this: If Shake Shack and McDonalds had a baby, it would be named In-N-Out.

There's a lot of hype surrounding this place, but not quite enough taste to back it up. Don't get me wrong, it's good...REALLY good for the price...but it's not in the same conversation as Shake Shack or Five Guys. It's just too ""fast foody"", if you will. 

If you're visiting the West Coast: GET IT. Get the double-double with Animal Style fries. But don't set your expectations too high, as you will probably be disappointed.

The taste has never changed since I remember the first time eating here many many years ago, which is a good thing!

I got me a 3x3 and animal style fries. Oh boy was I in calorie Heaven!

Do a quick Google search for ""In-N-Out secret menu"" and you'll get the full rundown. 

Drive-through is normally faster than getting it in the store but if you want to preserve the taste you should definitely eat it immediately after purchase. It's still amazing slightly cold, but there is a big difference when you eat it fresh off the burner.

We need this place on the west coast. I'm a huge Whataburger fan, and I have to admit, this places gives W a run for its money. But it's a slightly different style. 

We grabbed their fries, a few double-doubles, and a couple of shakes (chocolate and vanilla). We could only slightly tell the difference between the chocolate and vanilla. Not sure if that's a bad thing, but if I have a craving for a chocolate shake, I'll likely go elsewhere.

The DD was great! Juicy without being over-greasy. Just enough for lunch without feeling guilty. They know what they're doing. The bun was soft but had a slight crisp that worked very well with the lettuce and tomatoes. We option for onion which I normally love but I'm not sure it added anything.

I like their lettuce wrapped burger (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). They call it  ""protein style.""

Their french fries are actual slices of potatoes. I personally prefer the processed style fries at other restaurants (they mash the potatoes, reform them into sticks, bread them, and fry them). However, there is something homey and oddly nostalgic about natural fries cut from actual potato slices.

Super busy location but the staff handled it well. Got the protein burger animal style and an animal style hamburger and did not regret it.

Whenever I'm in Vegas (visiting relatives and avoiding the strip, of course), I pop by In-N-Out at least twice, because we don't have them here in NY and are forced to choke down (or in my case- avoid) the factory farmed monstrosity that is McD's.

This location: is clean.

The service: so friendly and courteous.  

The burgers & food: is  thebomb.com and dirt CHEAP!  The beef is freshly ground and juicy, the vegetables are plentiful and crunchy.   The sauce is pure love...and the fries are hot, crispy and with the right amount of salt.

And the shakes are heaven!  Thick, creamy, and top-quality.  My only warning to you my friends is that you drink it separately from your meal.  If you do not, your stomach will judge you forever.

My east coast friends- if you ever make a trip across the country, please visit the nearest In-N-Out...You won't regret it.",0,zXjR3YMVTA5qXhmUsS0Egg

Is In-N-Out Burger actually that good? Well we may not have the answers to some of these conundrums for a while (unless you've recently been abducted by aliens), but I was able to find a conclusion to that last one.

So maybe I was late to the proverbial party, but I hadn't had the opportunity to try In-N-Out for the first time until I ended up in Nevada back in September. The trek to this spot from Las Vegas Blvd is not as straightforward as one might hope, but I do pray someone reads this review and learns it is walkable, I promise!

Once there, you'll start to get this feeling like you're entering into a genuine food experience. I mean the place isn't spectacularly designed, but between the retro logo and little palm trees across the counter, you get this subtle Californian vibe you didn't know you wanted and you're glad you got.

The line was several people deep, but In-N-Out is a well-oiled machine and lives up to its name with the way it takes orders, calls out numbers, and keeps people moving. Plus, you can't really spend a while choosing because the menu is basic. Burger, Cheeseburger, Double Double (you can figure that one out), fries, and shakes. 

Okay, I'm no food novice. There's a little more to that menu than meets the eye, and I wasn't about to miss out on it. Animal style fries? Check. Neapolitan shake? Check. Throw in a Double Double and we're good....well, maybe I let my eyes do the talking because I also added a hamburger to that order (more on its unfortunate demise in a sec).

Verdict? Really good. Aesthetically, the Double Double was beautiful and it stayed together nicely through each juicy, meaty bite. The flavors blended perfectly and created a fast food burger above the caliber of most others. Beyond that staple, I did enjoy my beastly fries, though they fell a tad short of my expectations. I mean cheese, grilled onions, and their secret spread still tasted great on top of it all so don't shy away from this secret selection. The shake rounded things out nicely with its trio of flavors. 

Overall, I'm glad to have an answer to that edible life question: In-N-Out Burger is good. I'd say it's even great. Amazing? Maybe not, but I do wish my stomach was big enough to have eaten that extra burger. He met an untimely end in a garbage can along The Strip because I just couldn't eat anymore. Looking back, I wish I did because I'm craving some more In-N-Out and I'll be waiting til my next opportunity to continue to fulfill that food fantasy.",15,aGDtObhCNrySrrT2qpljfA

I told him I'd never been before so he explained what they have...burgers, burgers, burgers. I ordered a double double with no onions or special sauce (I don't like special sauce...I mean, I like my boyfriend's special sauce but it fortunately doesn't taste like Thousand Island dressing. Thank God!), fries, and the largest freakin diet coke they could give me. I was surprised at how freakin FRIENDLY all these mo' fo's working here were....every one of them was all smiles and thank yous and come agains. Wow, sure beats the grim faces of McDonalds! 

I got back to the Venetian and after finding my room in that labyrinth of a complex I sat down to eat. Burger - YESS! Yummers! Definitely trumps all other fast food burgers. Thick, juicy, meaty patties and a really great bun. Everything tasted fresh too which was a definite step up. Does it trump my fave burger joint? No, but it trumps Whataburger, McDonald's, Wendy's, etc. I would say it trumps Burger King but I never go there so I don't know. The fries were undersalted and not as crispy as I like them so there's the minus one star. And the drink was cold and restorative after a night out boozing it up like a rockstar. 

I wish they would put one of these on the strip somewhere so that I could go without spending $20 on a cab ride and $6 on food but I think for my first experience it was SO worth the money and I'd do it again in a second!",9,L27OShvycGmVOkAxD1h86A

Finally had a few hours to kill before my flight left and decided to make a pit stop here with a buddy of mine.  He was broke from the Vegas shenanigans so I offered to front the bill.  Between him and I, we had to double doubles (made mine animal or something), two sodas, and split an order of fries.  This only cost about $15, not a bad deal.

Not an extensive menu to choose from and after asking the guy at the counter, it was pretty straight forward to figure out.  Basically, how hungry are you?  Explained a little further down, I should have opted in for the choice below the double double, but I have no regrets.

The wait wasn't excruciating, granted we stepped in and ordered before a herd of about 20 people rolled in, but it was about a 5 minute wait to get the order.

Fries were meh...tasted like 10 minute old McDonalds fries, which is still good but meh.  THE BURGERS, MY GOD!  I don't know their trick but the patty was kinda crunchy on the very edges and just the right amount of greasy.  I can compare the taste to Elevation Burgers free range burgers, if anyone is familiar with them, they are in my top choice of burger joints.  My buddy had no trouble polishing off his double double but, sadly, i was a bite and a half from being able to finish before my stomach finally told me that my eyes were bigger than it was.

This is going to be the new tradition of being the first or last stop in my Vegas trips.  I can't believe it took me 6 trips to Vegas to even try it out.

  Dessert - None, do they really have any?

Service - We walked up and the cashier was doing something with a credit card and the till, just strange.  He indicated he would be right with us.  But with a few seconds another cashier got his till going and took our order.  Always fast friend service.

I'm from the East Coast, so this was my first experience with the famous In-N-Out Burger, which I found to be a lot of hype so we went there on 2/12/13. My friends and I asked our taxi driver to go through the drive thru window here because I wanted to check out what all of the fuss over this place was about. I got the Double Double Animal style w/ fries and a lemonade to drink. I enjoyed the burger, but felt it tasted almost exactly like a Big Mac from McDonalds (maybe a little fresher). The fries weren't seasons very well, if at all. While I enjoyed the food, I just didn't feel it was anything worth mentioning, and certainly not worth driving a distance away for. 

For all my friends on the West Coast always telling me how great this place is, I was anything but impressed.

Fresh pressed all beef patties that are pressed on a skillet; fresh crisp lettuce, a juicy tomato cut into a perfect slice, the bun is like that of a McDonalds cheeseburger only it's made fresh from scratch and perfectly toasted on the inside, and then the spread....

I remember the first time we met, in Los Angeles, way back in 1987. I fell in love with your double patties, and double cheese as it sensually dripped from your hot fresh toasted buns. We broke up after I moved back to Oregon, but I would dream of you, and when I came back you were my first stop to satisfy my needs.

Fast forward to 2015. Over the years I have continued to visit you off and on and it has always been good. Even though my cravings for your sweet delights have grown less, I always think of you and visit when possible.

This location, off the 95 and Lake Mead...is always busy. I mean the street going into the parking lot is packed full of waiting cars. Doesn't seem to matter when, what time of day or night. Expect to wait a good 25 minutes. If I could make something happen, it would be to remove the auto parts or whatever store is there along with the Arby's so there would be ease in parking and waiting. The amount of times I've stopped by only to venture elsewhere due to the wait and lines has been numerous. In N Out, you have become a popular and naughty girl. 

This burger on this occasion (pre-Oscar night at 5pm), wasn't up to your usual standards. If felt forced, almost mechanical. Your sweet juices didn't flow into my mouth. Perhaps you are becoming too busy, and your quality isn't up to normal. I still love you, but I might have to date others.",1,wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A

A double double, and French fries animal style.

I gotta tell ya, I was a little disappointed. Yes, it's a good burger. For a fast food chain, it's a very good burger...but a fast food burger nonetheless. More disappointing were the fries. I thought the fries themselves were soft and bland (I would return at a later date, and get my fries well done, but they were no better). Animal style was a definite improvement, but still not a sublime experience.

I've never tried it before or 2. because I wont have the chance elsewhere and well this was the case for In-n-out last week in Vegas.

We had eaten breakfast at Egg and I that morning and I had stuffed my face with pancakes, bacon, and eggs so I was planning on a light dinner. I spent the rest of the morning driving around and buying foodie goodies at random places I had bookmarked (Popped and Bouchon Bakery) So there had been close to NO exercise being done. 

When I got back to the hotel one of the first things my sister suggested we  do is go to in-n-out....She had just woken up from a 4 hour nap and she wants fast food? I was close to saying Sorry, no. But wait it's your 2nd to last day and you already decided your bringing Earls on the plane you won't have another chance said a devil voice in my head. Okay I said, let's go.

As we walked into In-N-Out  I was instantly transported back in time. The decor, the uniforms, the basic menu were all so 50's. I was a little
surprised to see how simple the menu was but better for me, less decisions to make. Although I probably would have just stuck to fries at any other fast food place else my inner devil foodie demanded I try a burger so I went with the combo 1, a cheeseburger and fries. 

My sister ordered before and got the infamous animal fries which I thought were only lathered with their special sauce...WRONG. They had melted cheese, the special sauce and grilled onions. Heartattack on the spot. :-) 

Honestly I wish I had gone a little hungrier because although I was able to eat half my burger and 1/4 of the fries I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I may have after a night of drinking or on an empty stomach....Regardless, it was fresh fresh fresh for fast food and I was happy to see a guy making the fries from potatoes in the back..

I think next time I'll stick to an animal burger and regular fries..

It is not a place for locals to go because of how busy it gets. Takes a while to get a order placed.

In Las Vegas , an der Sahara Avenue, sind wir eingekehrt, da die Filiale am Strip total überlaufen ist. Im Internet konnte ich nachlesen, dass es das Unternehmen bereits seit 1948 gibt und es mittlerweile ca. 300 Restaurants im Westen der USA und Texas gibt.

Am späten Abend war hier der Andrang nur mittelmäßig. Die Auswahl war einfach, da es nur drei verschiedene Burger und Pommes zur Auswahl gibt. Wenn man es dann zur Bestellung geschafft hat, bekommt man eine Nummer, die dann aufgerufen wird sobald die Bestellung fertig ist.

Auf die Burger kommt nur gekühltes und kein gefrorenes Frischfleisch, das von der eigenen Fleischfabrik innerhalb von 24 Stunden geliefert wird. Die Kartoffeln für die Pommes werden im Restaurant aus frischen Kartoffeln hergestellt. Ich konnte es selber in der offenen Küche sehen, wie ein Mitarbeiter die Kartoffeln geschält und gewürfelt hat.

Preislich bewegt man sich trotzdem weit unten, da man auf eine umfangreiche Auswahl verzichtet. Wenn man mit mehreren Leuten hier einkehrt, sollten die anderen ein Plätzchen im Restaurant sichern, da diese zu den Stoßzeiten ebenfalls rar sind.

Vor den meisten Läden findet man zwei gepflanzte Palmen, die gekreuzt wachsen und eine Anspielung auf den Lieblingsfilm des Inhabers ""Eine total, total verrückte Welt"" sein sollen. Eine weitere Marotte sind angedruckte Bibelstellen auf den Unterseiten der Getränkebecher.

Most every burger aficionado inhabiting California and Nevada now knows what to expect from an In-N-Out Burger: not a fancy gourmet burger but a great-tasting burger nevertheless, with astoundingly fresh ingredients, including a generous slice of ripe red tomato, crunchy green lettuce, and either a lovely cold and thick slice of White Onion or warm grilled onion ribbons, together with a foundation of nice and creamy Thousand Island Dressing slathered over the base of a soft and supple hamburger bun.  Whether a Double-Double, a Cheeseburger, or a Hamburger, the model is pretty much the same, and each variety of burger is surely enhanced by an order of freshly cut skin-on French Fries.  Liberally add readily available tomato ketchup to both burger and fries, and a memorable dining experience will be close at hand.

stepping off the plane, my friend and I wanted our very first stop to be In-N-Out, so we took a taxi there...yep, WITH our luggage...and found a table near probably the only outlet in the place, where the workers kept coming by asking if we were fine... not even giving us any sort of fuss about charging our phones and waiting for our third person to arrive two hours later.
*quick shout out to worker Ed for making us laugh with stories about how much Spirit Airlines sucks*

So the food:

I did a little research and found out about the secret menu and ordered the Double Double - Animal Syle combo. This was fast food but it was so different from McDonald's or Burger King. The beef tasted fresher and the animal style hint of mustard plus the secret sauce really made it stand out.

The customer service is always pretty good both inside and at the drive-thru.

Pretty nifty In-N-Out!

Their menu is simple yet so satisfying.  They only offer a few types of burgers but they do the job pretty well.  You can also ask for ""animal style"" burgers or fries, it's their own concoction of a sauce-very similar to Thousand Isle dressing.  I've had it but the burgers and fries taste delicious all on their own and you don't really need the dressing. 

I love, love, LOVE their french fries because they're freshly cut potatoes.  You can actually see the employees behind the counter using their handy-dandy potato slicer.  This makes that much of a difference because the fries taste so much better if they haven't been frozen.  

I think it's awesome that this location draws so many tourists.  Every time I'm here, I feel like I'm at the airport.

Better know what you want in advance or stand back so they can't corral you into placing your order.  If you step up to read the menu they'll pounce.

Large fries.

We only have one size, do you want more than one?

Well, how big is it?  

Shouting in a very grating voice, the order taker repeated:  We only have one size, do you want more than one? 

She's very impatient, demanding an immediate answer.  I wanted to tell her:  Take a breath.  It's not busy yet.  Just relax and let us place our order. Allow me to ask a fucking question about the fries.

""I understand the concept of just one one size and I'm not hard of hearing.""  She didn't respond. If a customer expresses displeasure just act like you didn't hear it. Since there is no way to gauge how many fries are in an order, we asked for two servings. 

One order is plenty, it turns out.  The fries were limp and saturated with stale grease.

I asked for my double double with grilled onions.  The burgers came with no indication which had onions.  No onions.  Some fast food eateries will put a mark on the wrapping to let you know it has onions.  At In N Out it's part of the secret menu.  Whether you actually get onions when you want them is their secret.

Everyone shouts here.  Very loud, hectic, and annoying.  Very unpleasant.  They're all hurry hurry, hurry hurry.  I could understand if it were busy but the store was practically empty.

The burgers are just fair, no better than Burger King or Carl's Jr.  The ""cheese"" is not actual cheese but a glue-like product that sticks to your teeth & gums. 

You want bacon?  Forget bacon.  In N Out's secret of success is very limited choices.  And if they don't feel like it, you won't get one of the few choices they offer.

Lady taking my order repeated my order and didn't mention ketchup. So I asked ""Did you get the ketchup on the burger too?"" She said (with extreme confidence) ""Yes!"" I pull up to the window to pay. The lady there (not sure if she was the same one taking the order thru the speaker) repeats my order back to me. Once again no mention of ketchup. I ask if they got the ketchup on the burger. She says no but she'll get it added on. I get my receipt at 4:40 and then wait for the 2 cars in front to go and it's not a long wait before they pull off. I pull up to the window and wait longer than the last two cars. I get my food at 4:52. Guess what? You got it! NO KETCHUP IN MY BURGER and the fries are overdone. So In-N-Out is known for their burgers, fries, and shakes. They got 2 out of 3 wrong.

My brother raves about In-N-Out, and my mother wanted to try it. So we decided to give this one a try, and it was significantly better than the other one. 

We walked in and they were busy. So we had to wait a bit. It wasn't a ridiculous wait though, it just wasn't quick. We all ordered burgers in a meal, so three burgers, three fries, and three drinks. It was kind of cool to look back in the kitchen and see an employee hand cutting the potatoes for the fries. 

My brother ordered our fries to be extra crispy, which is how I always like mine. Well.. these were definitely crispy. They weren't burnt, and they get props for that. But they were actually too crispy for my taste. I didn't know that was possible. But it took away any sort of taste to them and just turned them into crispy cardboard. I wasn't a fan. But that's OK. I wish I hadn't let him order mine that crispy, so I could taste how they are normally. That would be my one regret. 

Customer service was good. I had no complaints there, our orders were correct, served with a smile, and not ridiculous in price. The restaurant had obviously just had a rush, so things needed to be cleaned, but I did see employees go out to clean as things started to settle down. 

Would I return? Probably. I mean, I don't find IN-N-Out nearly as spectacular as some people do, but that's just me. I'm always entertained by those who rave about it. But I had no complaints.

It was something my mother wanted to try, and decided that's what we were doing for dinner that night. This was the closest location to where we were. 

Unfortunately, the parking lot was completely filled, and the drive-thru was overflowing. So there was almost no chance of parking. My mother has a handicap placard and so we were going to park there. If we didn't, we would have to go find parking somewhere else, like a block or two away and then walk back to the restaurant. 

What gives this place one single star is the fact the handicap parking place was filled... by an employee in uniform hanging out with his friends during his break. Obviously the friend couldn't find parking any better than we could, and just took a spot that wasn't meant for him. My brother, who was driving the car said something to the employee, who was very clearly just standing at the vehicle and talking/laughing with his friends. The employee basically said, sorry. Sucks to be you. It left a very bad impression. The employee treated it as if to say, look around. Do you really think you matter? This place is full. Who honestly gives a shit that you aren't going to eat here? That was the attitude this employee had, and it was absolute and complete disrespect. So we left. 

Would I return? Absolutely not. I don't need to go somewhere that employees disrespect potential customers, as well as people with disabilities and their need to use a clearly marked handicap parking space to bullshit with their friends on a busy night. There's more than one In-N-Out in Vegas. We went to find another one, and I'm glad we did. They didn't treat it like a frat house either.

I can't add much else to what other Yelpers have said.

I like that they slice and dice the potatoes for the fries right there before your eyes.

It's an exceptionally good burger, the double is a meal.

But but but, the animal style burger was very good. And the price tag was even better. We were completely sticker-shocked after spending a few days in Vegas. Side note here but if you ever wander up and down the strip, take note how much a cup of coffee costs at Starbucks. Outside the casinos: $1.40. Inside the casinos: $2.80+ Soo... how can a burger cost $2??? Which, of course, just made me even more angry that night when I paid $46 for the Wynn buffet...

I would definitely recommend getting the burger animal-style... bf likes his burgers ""classic"" and he got screweddd. what a sucker. The difference lies in the pickles, the caramelized onions, and the sauce. He got... I don't even remember what was in it besides tomato, lettuce, and cheese because I took a bite and went ""HA!"" then continued eating mine.

Still, West Coasters need to stop prancing about In-n-Out like it's the queen of freaking Sheba. One friend (from California, mind you) claimed the burgers in the LV joint weren't as good as the ones from California. For that, I call his big fat bluff. But I could go for a double double animal-style right now...

I really was just referring to the burger, guys.",3,euDIcWuz_Uka8XuBT0dHVg

They told me over phone I could either have a whole meal sent to me or just go to store to pick up burger . I went to pick up burger wasted 40 extra minutes of my life for them to just give me burger didn't even offer to make it right by at least getting me extra fries . I really don't appreciate their service . I work in the customer service industry as a supervisor and I know I make it right by giving my customer extra things when I know we mest it up .
